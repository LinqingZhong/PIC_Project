{"text": "Projects such as the Balanced Energy Network [41],which pull heat from the ground,if implemented at sufficient scale,will face constraints of heat removal from soil.At some point a heat-sharing network like BEN will create a situation where the removal of heat from the ground at one point in the network negatively impacts the performance of the neighboring ground source system.Thus,the logical conclusion would be to introduce cooling of buildings and discharge of the collected heat back into the ground which given the rising temperatures in city centers could be a convenient by-product."}
{"text": "Planning the storage and transfer of heat through the ground is not a task for in- dividual building projects.Energy management across an estate such as a university campus,housing development,or hospital estate will become increasingly common and its success will depend on early stage discussions between civil and building services engineers to understand how the heating,cooling,and electrical,and even water systems can work together most effectively.Collaborations such as that between the ICE and CIBSE will be essential in building the professional networks to enable this."}
{"text": "28.16 Conclusion\n\nLow-carbon cities are the great challenge for the 21st century.In the United Kingdom, this is above all a heating challenge.There are a number of theoretical options,but no preferred pathway.Ultimately the solution will be a combination of options including electrification of heat and transport,and a use of carbon-free gas such as hydrogen.It is widely agreed that delivering this combination cost-effectively will require a revolution in energy infrastructure,particularly making use of demand reduction,storage,demand side response,and better integration of smart systems across multiple energy vectors. The BEN case study shows that delivering these upgrades within cities is a challenge,but a manageable one,and that early efforts should focus on replicable demonstration projects that can expand organically over time."}
{"text": "The low-carbon energy transformation will create a built environment in which en- ergy demand is not driven by standalone end users,but by participants in an energy system.Estate energy management will recover and share heat across stores,and use new revenue models to increase system efficiencies and balance supply and demand. This will require a deep collaboration and even integration of disciplines across the built environment."}

{"text": "29.1.2 Inventory analysis\n\nThe life cycle inventory (LCD)analysis is the heart ofthe LCA process,since it is involved with actual data collection,validation,and calculation procedures.Data collection sheets should be prepared and the data should be validated by process experts as re- viewers.After validation,data can be converted to units per functional unit basis.The functional unit is the reference unit of a product or process for which quantified per- formance is measured in an LCA study.Where allocation or partitioning of impacts are required due to multiple products or reuse and recycling in the process,the impacts can be shared based on mass allocation of the flow by weight basis or economic allocation based on annual average prices over a number of years.According to international standards,allocation should be avoided,where possible,by expanding the process system.If it cannot be avoided,the basis of allocation and procedures should be clearly stated."}
{"text": "29.1.3 Life cycle impact assessment\n\nLife cycle impact assessment aims to examine the process or product system from an environmental perspective using impact categories and category indicators connected with LCA results.The characterization models are used for developing units of impact indicators.For example,one common characterization model for global warming po- tential (GWP)is Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC)model.According to this model,greenhouse gas(GHG)emission is reported in carbon dioxide equivalent units. This is a quantity that describes for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gas,the amount of CO₂that would have the same global warming potential(GWP),when measured over a specified timescale(generally,100 years).According this model,the CO₂ equivalent of methane emission is 25.This is the characterization factor for methane, which means 1kg of methane emission will have same GWP impact as 25kg of CO₂ ."}
{"text": "Often,many of indicators are not easy to understand.This is why a simplified set of indicators has been used for the studies undertaken by this author.This indicator set has been introduced as ECWW or energy,carbon dioxide,water,and waste footprint of a process or product to determine its environmental sustainability performance."}
{"text": "Finally,an area which is being developed within the LCA community and which is largely subjective,is putting a weight factor for each of these areas (i.e.,human,envi- ronment,socioeconomic,and resources)based on agreed percent by the stakeholders depending on specific circumstances.Common impact categories of so called midpoint and end point are defined in the UNEP/SETAC guidelines [8].The midpoint categories are between the LCI and the final damage,whereas the end point indicators are the resultant impacts of an activity."}
{"text": "29.1.4 Interpretation and application\n\nThe main objectives of life cycle interpretation are to analyze results,reach conclusions, state limitations,and provide recommendations (see Fig.29.1).The essential aim is to gain as much insight as possible about the processes throughout the life cycle in order to identify opportunities to reduce impacts.The interpretation covers the process activity as defined with the goal and scope of the study and released to the intended audience."}
{"text": "29.2 Energy\n\nIn a practical sense,energy(e.g.,potential or kinetic/mechanical)is used to perform a work or provide heat by increasing the temperature of an object.Thermal energy is to provide heat and this heat can be used to generate steam which in turn can be used to turn a turbine to produce electricity.Here in the context of LCA,two main uses of energy will be dealt with.One is the thermal energy and other is electrical energy.In a sense, electrical energy is the final product expressed in kWh unit,whereas thermal energy is the input to produce electricity expressed in kJ or MJ.In many case,thermal energy is directly used without converting it to electricity (e.g.,industrial or space heating or residential heating)."}
{"text": "The emission arising from the use of machinery in underground mining is due to the use of diesel and electricity (from the grid or from the stationery diesel generated power). Fugitive emission is also accounted for.Total overall emission factor has to be calculated based on the energy required to produce one tonne of coal which can be referred to as a so-called functional unit in LCA."}
{"text": "When this coal is combusted for producing heat,the functional unit will be a meg- ajoule (MJ)of energy.However,when electricity is generated at a power plant,the functional unit is a megawatt-hour(MWh).After the combustion of the coal in the power plant (called parasitic power),the electrical power(MWh)is sent via high voltage power lines(with transmission losses)and finally via low voltage power lines when it is delivered to the consumers.The net delivered power functional unit is again the MWh. The life cycle-based approach can be applied to all these power systems and can be referred to as\"cradle-to-gate\"system.In this case,\"mine to the national grid\"can be the boundary for LCA of one MWh power delivered to the consumers.If waste generation is considered,then it can be treated as a \"cradle-to-grave\"system.The simplified flow sheet of coal production is shown in Fig.29.2."}
{"text": "Extensive research has been conducted on the GHG emissions associated with fossil fuel-based energy sources across the whole life cycle,and a significant quantity of data is readily available.However,less research has been conducted on LNGenergy sources and as a result,considerable data gaps and lack of knowledge surrounding LNG exist,particularly when thewhole life cycle(from extraction toend-use)is consideredsuchas shownin Fig.29.3."}
{"text": "29.3.3 Petroleum,diesel\n\nThe petroleum industry follows a process chain that involves exploration,extraction, processing(refining),distribution and delivery to the end user for combustion,transport, producing heat energy and power generation.This simplified representation(see Fig.29.4)is a common process chain among the petroleum producers worldwide."}
{"text": "29.3.4 Results from LCA studies\n\nLife cycle-based greenhouse gas emission is usually calculated for 1Mwh of delivered electricity to users.This emission is comprised of several stages:exploration,extraction of fuel,processing of fuel,shipping or transport to a power plant,combustion,power production and distribution.There are a number of factors that influence the net delivered power.The gross or net energy value of a fuel(so-called lower or higher heating value(LHV,HHV)or calorific value(CV)will depend on its purity,carbon content and chemical make-up,and physical properties such as density."}
{"text": "The next factor is the efficiency of the combustion and heat recovery.Generally fuel is combusted in a boiler to produce heat energy to generate steam,which eventually is used to turn a turbine system to produce electrical power.Usually the electricity is transmitted long distances by the high-voltage transmission lines followed by voltage reduction at transformer stations in order to reach consumers.The life cycle-based greenhouse gas for the production of 1Mwh of electricity takes into account all the stages involved."}
{"text": "Calculation has been made for a variety of fossil fuels using a life cycle assessment based methodology.The results are broadly grouped under fuel preparation and fuel combustion including other losses and are shown in Fig.29.5."}
{"text": "Coal contributes to about 41%of the global electricity generation with over 66% contribution to global greenhouse gas emission for electricity production [11] .Coal fired power plants operate on the modified Rankine thermodynamic cycle.The efficiency is achieved by manipulating conditions of this thermodynamic cycle.The overall coal plant efficiency is dependent on the degree of superheating,the reheated steam temperature and the operating pressure.Most of the large power plants operate at steam pressures of 170 bar and superheated and reheated temperatures of 570℃.Supercritical power plants operate at 220 bar and 600℃,whereas ultrasupercritical power plants operate at 300 bar pressure and in some cases,much higher temperatures are used than in supercritical power plants."}
{"text": "Natural gas fired power plants (including regasified LNG)account for about 20%of total electricity generation in the world with over 23%contribution to global GHG emission due to electricity production [11].These power plants use gas turbines which run in a simple cycle mode.The most important parameter that influences the efficiency is the maximum gas temperature.The latest gas turbines in operation,use of techno- logical advances in materials,and aerodynamics in the combined cycle mode can reduce emission.The new so called \"H class'turbines with a triple pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG)and steam turbine can achieve efficiencies of up to 60%.This being the maximum for current thermal power plants."}
{"text": "Overall,coal is more damaging to human health and the ecosystem than is natural gas.However,the impact on resource depletion is significantly higher for gas than that of coal.This indicates that the coal is significantly more abundant that natural gas."}
{"text": "It must be noted that these values have significant uncertainty.However,the objective of showing these results is to demonstrate the importance of a complete LCA study and to compare various indicators,just not only the greenhouse gas and the usefulness of such complete evaluation."}
{"text": "require neodymium magnets,a rare metal,and large steel tower structures to support the turbines.The hydroelectricity requires the building of a large dams and walls and structures to manage the flow of the water through turbines to generate electricity.These material inputs all energy.Taking these energy demands into account,LCA shows that renewable energy systems are likely to contribute to less than 10%of global GHG emission [3,4] as compared to present fossil fuel electricity production."}
{"text": "lower ore grades and associated higher greenhouse gas footprint would be reached much sooner [12].The greenhouse gas emission results reported for nuclear electricity in the literature are shown in Fig.29.7 [12]."}
{"text": "29.9 The future\n\nLCA is evolving as a discipline.The key to an LCA study is the delineation of the appropriate boundary and the availability of good quality input data.There are a number of initiatives of data collections that are in place nationally and globally,albeit at a slow pace.The reason is that for good quality data collection,a combination of skills of process system engineering knowledge and LCA thinking are required.Having combi- nations of these are limited in the current community of many expert LCA professionals and organizations.The other reason is that it is quite complex,time consuming,and is a resource intensive process.A large pool of fund is required for good quality data and is required from a range of industry sectors.In many cases,industry is not keen to share information as many of the input data are treated as commercially sensitive and not publicly disclosable.In that case,an average data is lumped together and presented for a process treating it as a black box.Understanding and interpreting results from such input data set often pose significant challenges.This is why there are large difference between results from two LCA studies,and decisions taken based on LCA results are practically difficult.For example,it is hard to select a particularly technology,e.g.,gas versus coal versus nuclear,where there are a number of indicators with varied impact, and in addition,there is a variation which needs quantification.Proper LCA requires a large amount of financial resources to collect data which may help in making this kind of decision on technology choices."}
{"text": "29.10 Source of additional information\n\nLCA applications in industrial contexts have been published [13-15] .There are several LCA software packages such as SimaPro,GaBi,Umberto,OpenLCA,and databases available that readers can explore further.The LCA discipline has publications covering relevant studies in established scientific journals,predominantly in the International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,the Journal of Cleaner Production,and the Jourmal of Industrial Ecology."}

{"text": "For many electricity networks,decarbonization poses multiple problems.There is the issue of increasing demand for electricity,particularly if heat and transport demand shifts with respect to primary energy source,from liquid and gas fossil fuels to electricity.Within that picture of growing demand is the complexity of growth in peak power and growth in annual energy.To meet that demand,using lower and zero carbon sources of electricity generation means a consequential growth in the use of renewable energy technologies. The available options to decarbonize the electricity sector in the United Kingdom are nuclear power,large-scale renewables,fossil fuel power stations with carbon capture and sequestration (not yet a mature technology),and small-scale renewables [3]."}
{"text": "The fall in price of solar PV systems over the last decade [6]and government subsidies have resulted in an increased number of solar PV systems with cumulative installed PV capacity in the United Kingdom reaching 13 GW by mid-2018 [5].The total installed wind capacity by mid-2018 was 21 GW in the United Kingdom [5],driven by falling costs of onshore and offshore wind turbine technology,as well as offshore development driven by the Crown Estate [7].There are a number of financial support mechanisms in place which enable,and have supported the recent growth of,renewable energy for electricity generation in the United Kingdom:renewables obligation,feed-in tariff,and contracts for difference(CfD).The CfD second round strike price for offshore wind was f74.75 (MWh)-¹and f57.50(MWh)-¹[8],lower than the f92.50(MWh)-¹agreed for the new Hinkley nuclear power station."}
{"text": "The operational management complexity of intermittent and stochastic generation and demand has been expressed by several authors [9,10].Balancing supply and demand in real time on the electricity network is required to maintain quality of supply.The quality of supply for an electricity network is ensured by managing and mitigating dis- turbances such as voltage dips,voltage surges,overvoltage,harmonics,power frequency variations,voltage fluctuations,rapid voltage change,voltage imbalance,short-and long-voltage interruptions,and under voltage and transients.Intermittency of some generation sources can be managed through flexibility in other generation technologies, storage,and flexibility(or control)in energy demand."}
{"text": "installation directly onto the grid by electricity distribution network operators (DNO)to manage network power flow(Fig.30.1)."}
{"text": "We assessed the impact of multiple PV dispersion levels,pn,on the voltage regulation in multiple LV networks and the subsequent effect of energy storage randomly installed in customer homes with dispersion qn or sited by DNOs to manage overvoltage.Load flow was implemented in Matlab using OpenDSS network models.For the domestic installation study,storage was assumed for each home with PV with a probability qn.A load flow was then used to calculate the voltage rise.If there is overvoltage,this is recorded.Storage was represented as a load charging to absorb excess PV with rating PEs. For the DNO installation study,a genetic algorithm was used from the Matlab Global Optimisation Toolbox,which identified the locations of storage in network,n,to prevent overvoltage with fewest storage units in the network."}
{"text": "Without storage,and for three PV penetration scenarios,we investigate projected PV dispersion levels,pn,in each network n to identify the number of feeders forecast to experience overvoltage (total number of feeders investigated:43,816),as shown in Fig.30.2."}
{"text": "does reduce the number of feeders with overvoltage (from 1250 in year 35 with no storage to 1150 with 5%and 1000 with 15%PV with storage).DNO sited storage is,by nature of the algorithm,able to solve overvoltage.It does so with reduced total installed storage capacity compared with the domestic installations (Fig.30.3)."}
{"text": "Finally,we considered the costs of each approach.We assumed problematic feeders were upgraded to cope with overvoltage,by multiplying the length of each problematic feeder by a reconductoring cost (E80 m-¹).The storage was assumed to be lithium-ion batteries,which represented the most widely deployed battery type in residential po- wer networks.Prices of these have fallen significantly in recent years,and representative battery costs were sourced through an industrial survey as well as literature search. Energy storage located by the DNO is cheaper than all other options,for the DNO,as shown in Fig.30.4."}
{"text": "The results of this work showed that,if storage is used along side PV as a means to reduce overvoltage in LV networks,it should be carefully located by the DNO within an LV network using a heuristic method to minimize a DNO's overall cost.Storage may still offer benefits to homeowners if located in domestic homes,and domestic installation does have a benefit to DNOs in reducing overall reinforcement costs.However,it is found that storage in homes will not prevent all overvoltage because the location of the storage in networks is not optimized for overvoltage reduction in this case."}
{"text": "30.3.1 Vanadium redox Flow Batteries\n\nFlow batteries are an energy storage technology in which liquid electrolytes are stored in tanks and pumped into cells to produce electrochemical reactions [21,26].The vanadium redox flow battery is a technology characterized by the redox reactions of different ionic forms of vanadium [11].As the electrolyte tanks and power stacks are separated,the energy capacity of these batteries can be increased or reduced based on the tanks' volume,while the power capacity depends on the number of cells in the power stacks. This flexible decoupling of power and energy (from kW and kWh to larger scales of MW and MWh [15])makes this technology attractive for grid-scale energy applications [13]."}
{"text": "30.3.2 Supercapacitors\n\nSupercapacitors store energy as an electrical charge and consist of a porous separator between two conductor electrodes and an electrolyte [13,21].They can achieve higher energy density than capacitors due to the porous electrodes with high surface area.This technology can reach much higher power rating than batteries with fast charge/ discharge cycles,but it also presents a high self-discharge [21,29,30].It is attractive for short-term responses such as frequency grid services.Supercapacitors have a long life- time (i.e.,very high number of charge/discharge cycles);their energy efficiency is heavily dependent on their discharge rate [31]and,dependent on construction and voltage,can vary from 52%to 96%[18];this illustrates the need to design energy storage technologies based on their intended applications.Supercapacitors have a high energy capacity cost in comparison with similar energy storage alternatives 13] ."}
{"text": "30.3.3 Lead acid batteries\n\nLead acid batteries are the most mature battery technology,and they initially dominated the world market in small-and medium-scale electrochemical energy storage applica- tions [13,21].This technology consists of stacked cells submerged into an electrolyte comprising a sulfuric acid [11].The cells have a lead dioxide-positive electrode and a metallic lead-negative electrode,which together become lead sulfate during the discharge process [13]."}
{"text": "30.3.5 Sodium-sulfur battery\n\nSodium-sulfur (NaS)batteries are a promising energy storage technology for a number of applications,particularly those requiring high-power responses [11,21].It is composed of a sodium-negative electrode,a sulfur cathode,and a beta-alumina solid electrolyte that produces sodium pentasulfide during the discharge reaction [21].The primary strength of this technology is its long discharge time.It operates at a high- temperature regimen of 300-350℃,which might represent a challenge for certain conditions [11].Sodium-sulfur batteries require rigorous safety measures,as they contain hazardous components,such as metallic sodium,which is combustible when combined with water [11].There is a large-scale project is in Rokkasho village,Japan (34 MW),and there are a number of commercially available products such as a 50 kW NaS battery systems that can discharge for 7h at rated power [15,21].When NaS bat- teries are used for short-term applications,the power can reach five times the rated power.These devices have a round trip efficiency of 75%,high energy density,low maintenance,99%recyclability,and low self-discharge [21,22].Their lifetime is pro- jected to be 15 years and 4500 cycles [11,22]."}
{"text": "30.3.6 Pumped hydro energy storage\n\nPumped hydro energy storage(PHES)is among the most mature,flexible,and efficient forms of large-scale energy storage [16,17].The technology works by pumping water from low-altitude reservoirs to upper reservoirs to exploit the gravitational potential energy of the water [21].The discharging cycle releases the water from the high-altitude reservoir and extracts energy through a hydroelectric turbine."}
{"text": "30.3.7 Compressed air energy storage (CAES)\n\nIn compressed air energy storage(CAES),energy is stored in the form of high-pressure compressed air,which is then used to generate electricity via a turbine [24].Globally, there are a handful of installations,with power capacities varying from 80 kWto 321 MW (at McIntosh CAES plant in the United States).CAES typically has capital costs varying from $400 to $800(kW)-¹,a cycle efficiency of 40%-60%,and a lifetime of 20-40 years [24].Adiabatic CAES offers increased cycle efficiency (50%-70%),but with capital costs closer to $1000(kW)-¹[25]."}
{"text": "An extension of this approach is to use liquid air energy storage (LAES),which uses liquefied air or nitrogen as a storage medium [35].LAES offers round trip efficiencies of 50%-60%,but this can be significantly improved if waste heat is available.Liquid air can be stored in a tank,so it can be deployed on many more sites than CAES."}
{"text": "30.3.8 Thermal energy storage (TES)\n\nThermal energy storage(TES)comprises a collection of technologies that store energy in thermal form (heat or cold)either directly or indirectly through energy conversion processes.Grid-scale TES technologies include cryogenic energy storage [36]and pumped thermal electricity storage [37].TES currently accounts for approximately 55% of global nonpumped hydro installations [13],and its installed power capacities vary from 5kW to 360 MW at Pedro de Valdivia CSP power plant.The existence of grid- integrated systems makes it attractive for wholesale market services coupled with its overall system efficiency and high energy density.TES is the least cost energy storage technology,with sensible thermal energy storage at<5f(kWh)-¹[39].Other classes in its family are latent heat storage generally <50f(kWh)-¹)and the most expensive thermochemical energy storage(>100f(kWh)-¹)[40].TES technologies have response times of a few minutes to tens of minutes and are therefore suited for energy-rather than power-led applications."}
{"text": "30.3.11 Hybridization of energy storage systems\n\nA hybrid energy storage system (HESS)refers to the combination of multiple energy storage technologies with the aim of exploiting their individual advantages and miti- gating their drawbacks [45].The most common configuration in the literature merges high-power,fast-response devices with high-capacity technologies to address one or more services [46].However,the criteria for selecting hybrid technologies can also account for a number of additional characteristics,such as individual response time, cycle efficiency,cycle lifetime,self-discharge rate,initial investment costs,operation and maintenance costs,location,and potential revenue streams [12,46,47].As the capital cost of investment required for hybridizing a system might be higher than for a single-energy storage technology,a number of approaches,such as active or passive coupling architecture [48],control techniques,or relative sizing methodologies can be considered to maximize the technical and economic benefits of hybridization [12,19,38]."}
{"text": "The optimal sizing of HESS is a planning process to determine the power and energy ratings of each storage device by allocating their cost of power(e.g.,$MW-¹)and cost of energy($(MWh)-¹)in the most efficient and useful way according to the system's ob- jectives [49-51]."}
{"text": "30.4.1 Power conversion for energy storage systems\n\nPower electronic conversion units serve as a key enabling technology in the continued growth of grid-scale energy storage.Currently,30%of all electric power generated uses power electronics technologies somewhere between the point of generation and end use [52,53],and this is expected to increase in the future.In this section,we briefly discuss some technical and commercial considerations for the selection of PCS for battery ESSs and the limitations for applications at different power scales."}
{"text": "3. The battery management system (BMS):The BMS operates down to a cell level to ensure that safe electrical and environmental (principally temperature)operation is maintained at all times.In large(MW-scale)battery systems,many thousands of\n\nindividual cells need to be continuously monitored on an individual basis [56].The control modes,for example,grid-connected,islanded,and antiislanding and unin- terruptible power supply,can also be included within the BMS."}
{"text": "4.Multiple functionality:A HESS will require more flexibility on the battery side con- verter,while a storage system fulfilling multiple applications [57]will require more flexibility on the grid-side converter (for example,to meet both P and Q re-\n\nquirements simultaneously and to operate on different timescales)."}
{"text": "5. The communication interface:This is crucial for sending set points and commands to inverters and is usually either though Modbus,Canbus,Ethernet,or a\n\ncombination."}
{"text": "6. Commercial applications:Inverters at distribution scale are mostly PV inverters, some options such as string inverters connect multiple inverters together.Others include central inverters,battery inverters,transformer,and transformerless in- verters [54]."}
{"text": "30.4.1.1 Power electronics devices for PCS\n\nThe future of PCS for BESS will rely on affordable power electronic devices that can deliver high-power densities.Recent advances in research have yielded gallium nitride (GaN)[58]and silicon carbide(SiC)[59]devices,which are at the forefront of making this possible.An example is the ARPAVE ADEPT (Washington,DC,USA)program with HRL Laboratories (Malibu,CA,USA)[53,60].This converter will utilize GaN devices,offering high speed and efficient performance.Improved efficiency and faster switching (increased modulation range)have been a critical motivation for the use of GaN and SiC devices."}
{"text": "30.4.1.2 Single stage converters\n\nA single-stage convertor comprises a bidirectional AC/DC converter that facilitates the transfer of energy between the DC energy storage medium and the AC electrical network, as shown in Fig.30.5 [61].A variety of topologies exist,including single-and three-phase H-bridge designs [62]and those based on other technologies,such as buck [63]or bidirectional matrix [64]converters.The main advantages of single-stage converters are the low cost,low device count,and reduced losses.However,they present major dis- advantages,particularly in terms of reliability;because the storage medium must interface to a single DC connection,a single cell failure will result in a system failure and the need to bypass or replace the failed cell.There is also a limitation in the magnitudes of voltages that can be accommodated [61]."}
{"text": "30.4.1.4 Multilevel converters\n\nA multilevel converter is designed to deliver a desired AC voltage resulting from multiple DC converter stages.A number of multilevel structures exist,including the cascaded H- bridge converter(CHB)[67];neutral point clamped converters;flying capacitor multi- level inverters(FC)[68];and modular multilevel converters(MMC),which are based on a combination of CHB and FC topologies.Multilevel converters have several advantages, particularly the CHB and MMC configurations,whose modular structures allow reduced manufacturing costs.The redundant levels can increase reliability,and the multiple stages increase the power quality at the AC terminals [61].However,the high number of switches leads to higher costs than simpler converter topologies."}
{"text": "30.4.1.5 Price comparison of PCS technology providers\n\nThe market for inverters has been expanding over recent years with the increase in solar capacity in the grid.The key technology providers in the market include SMA, Victron,Huawei,ABB,SolarEdge,and Sungrow.Of these providers,SMA is the world's largest supplier with a market share of 14%[69];but with increased competition from Huawei,SolarEdge,and Sungrow,this has been declining in recent years."}
{"text": "to reflect of the price per kW and give a picture of how this relates at different power scales."}
{"text": "Fig.30.7 shows that the price range of inverters vary between the$150(kW)-¹and $800(kW)-¹within the power ranges of 1-60 kW.The trend of the moving average of prices is also shown to decay exponentially as power is scaled up.This can be explained as the cost of devices and components in the buildup does not increase linearly with power.For power ratings above 60 kW,these would not be off-the-shelf retail products, and prices would need to be quoted on a case-by-case basis."}
{"text": "30.4.2 Control of energy storage systems\n\nDeploying ESSs to fulfill network service requirements results in unique control chal- lenges on a variety of timescales.Because an ESS has a finite energy capacity,its SoC must be managed to ensure that contracted services can be delivered.The charging and discharging of the asset may be constrained by other service contracts or local network limitations.This leads to the requirement of a forecasting and scheduling system [57]to optimize the system's operation on a timescale of days to hours.Once a network service is required,a real-time local or distributed [71]control system is required to ensure that the ESS delivers the mandated levels of real and reactive power to fulfill the service obligations.In some cases,these may require modeling of the local network [72],in other cases,it could be sufficient to follow an agreed response profile to a single,local variable. The inputs and interactions between these controllers are illustrated in Fig.30.8."}
{"text": "In addition to this,an ESS is a complex system,comprising a number of subsystems to deal with energy conversion and storage [73];each of these subsystems will typically comprise many components,for example,the storage medium for a grid-scale ESS could contain many thousands of battery cells.BMS is needed to coordinate the operation of these subsystems to ensure the system's efficiency,reliability,and longevity [74,75].The most advanced BMS can incorporate physics-based models of the storage medium, enabling online performance management to improve the lifetime and efficiency of the ESS [75]."}
{"text": "Finally,many ancillary services may have strict monitoring and control requirements\n\nto ensure full remuneration.Therefore,if an ESS is intended to participate in multiple services throughout its lifetime [76],a fast,flexible,and low-level control system is essential."}

{"text": "about 10 such wedges would be required to limit the global temperature increase to below 3℃.The authors estimated that all carbon emissions from 800 large coal-fired power plants would need to be captured and stored to achieve one 25 Gt wedge.Celia et al.[2]estimate that this would entail a stored CO₂volume of2×10¹m³,equivalent to total global oil and gas production over a 50-year period.Along with the logistical issues of injecting large volumes of CO₂underground,capturing CO₂from flue gas requires additional energy;current retrofit capture technologies may require up to 30%of the original power plant energy output.Nonetheless,future energy mix scenarios that limit global temperature increases to 1.5 or 2℃ often include CCS as a major contributor [3]. Studies have also shown that reaching the climate change targets of 1.5 or 2℃ tem- perature increase without CCS would be significantly more expensive [4],if it is at all possible.Also,electricity generation from biomass in combination with CCS (BECCS) could be used as a negative carbon emissions technology [5],where biomass takes up CO₂from the atmosphere during its growth and CCS is employed during the combustion of the biomass to divert CO₂from the atmosphere.Lastly,eliminating CO₂emissions from some industrial sources such as cement and steel production may be difficult,so that CCS may be the best option for decarbonizing some industries [6].For these rea- sons,CCS needs to be considered as part of a low-carbon energy mix,especially in the medium-term future."}
{"text": "CCS operations consist of three major parts:CO₂capture at a large stationary source (e.g.,coal-fired power plant),transport of the captured CO₂to a storage site,and in- jection of CO₂into the subsurface for permanent storage.Capture occurs either through chemical transformation before the fossil fuel is combusted (precombustion) or through physiochemical processes(e.g.,adsorption)from the flue gas (post- combustion).The CO₂is then pressurized to reduce volume and dried to reduce corrosion.Unless the storage site is collocated with the source,CO₂needs to be transported to the storage site.While trucks or ships may be appropriate for smaller CCS operations,pipeline transport is most appropriate for industrial-scale CCS oper- ations,due to the large volumes of CO₂.At the storage site,CO₂is injected into the deep subsurface for permanent storage.Storage formations consist of porous rocks,such as sandstone,and are either saline aquifers or depleted/current oil and gas fields. Monitoring in the injection formation and in shallower formations is used to ensure that the injected CO₂remains in the storage formation,and no significant amount of CO₂leaks to shallower formations or the atmosphere.Storage in unmineable coal seams and at the bottom of deep oceans has also been considered but has been found to be impractical due to technical issues [7]."}
{"text": "While permanent storage is the ultimate goal of CCS,the captured CO₂may also be utilized as feedstock for industrial processes [8]and to enhance oil production [9].In CO₂enhanced oil recovery(CO₂-EOR),CO₂is injected into oil fields,and otherwise, immobile oil dissolves into the CO₂and can thus be produced.Some of the CO₂remains in the formation during CO₂-EOR,and a large volume of CO₂is left in the formation at the end of the CO₂-EOR operation,so that CO₂-EOR is considered a form of storage."}
{"text": "One of the main impediments to the deployment of CCS is a lack of incentives for power plant operators to capture and store CO₂.As long as CO₂emissions to the at- mosphere are free of cost,operators have little reason to spend additional money and energy for CCS.However,operators see CCS as an option when faced with CO₂emission costs.For instance,the Norwegian oil company Statoil-now Equinor-found it more economical to capture and store CO₂at two off-shore natural gas processing plants rather than pay a CO2 emission tax.Another taxation example is the 45Q tax credit for CO₂storage recently implemented in the United States.Monetization of carbon emis- sions,such as taxation and cap-and-trade systems,needs to increase to make CCS viable. While there are opportunities to improve the energy efficiency and cost of CCS,there do not seem to be any major technological impediments for CCS.Utilization of captured CO₂for CO₂-EOR is helping the development and operational knowledge of carbon capture,but it should only be viewed as a stepping stone,as dedicated storage will be necessary for CCS to be effective as a climate mitigation technology."}

{"text": "\"scrubber\"in the treatment of power plant flue gas.A common approach for gas sep- aration is the use of counterflow reactors,where gas flows in one direction and an absorbing solution flows in the opposite direction (Fig.31.3).As the gas flows through the reactor,it is contacted by the solvent,and the targeted constituent—in this case CO₂—is absorbed by the solvent,thus being removed from the gas.These reactors— termed scrubbers—are often tall columns packed with trays to increase the contact time between the gas and the solvent,where the gas flows upward and the solvent downward. The gas then leaves the reactor with most,or all,of the target constituent removed. Depending on the intended fate of the captured constituent,the constituent is removed from the solvent,and the liquid is reused in the reactor or the solvent including the constituent is treated together for their intended end use."}
{"text": "Aside from the cost of purchasing the solvent,the energy involved in the stripping process is the main cost factor.Early CO₂capture operations required about 4.1GJ (10⁹J per metric tonne of CO₂captured,but current facilities have reduced the energy use to around 2.6 GJ,a reduction of about 30%[12].Research into novel amine-based solvents and optimized facility operation is ongoing,and laboratory-scale experiments have reported energy requirements as low as 1.1GJ [13].Research is also ongoing on reducing solvent degradation due to other constituents in the flue gas(e.g.,SO₂)and high temperatures,reducing solvent emissions,improving process monitoring,and optimizing solvent management [12]."}
{"text": "While amine-based solvents are currently the only CO₂postcombustion capture technology deployed at the industrial scale (i.e.,>1Mt per year),other approaches are also under development.Abanades et al.[14] give a detailed review of recent de- velopments of alternative postcombustion CO₂capture technologies,and only a subset of them is highlighted here.One alternative technology is sorption to solids,where the flue gas flows through a reactor packed with a material that adsorbs CO₂,removing CO₂ from the flue gas.Once the sorption capacity has been reached,the material needs to be regenerated by removing CO₂.This is achieved by reducing the pressure (pressure swing adsorption)or by increasing the temperature (temperature swing adsorption).Examples for solid sorbents are metal-organic frameworks(a synthetic combination of metals and organic compounds)and zeolites.Capturing CO₂from flue gas involves a constant stream of gas,requiring multiple sorption reactors,where some are capturing CO₂and the others are being regenerated;this allows for the continuous treatment of flue gas. Sorption is a kinetic process,and the cycle time(i.e.,the time to reach sorption capacity and regeneration once)is an important material-specific design factor.Materials with longer cycle times require a larger reaction volume (i.e.,larger reactors,more reactors), which increases space requirements and cost.Energy requirements for systems tested at the pilot-scale are in the range of 1.7-2.8 GJt-¹(where t refers to metric tonne)of CO₂ captured for recoveries between 80%and 90%[15-18].There are currently no industrial- scale CO₂capture operations using solid sorbents,but research is ongoing for materials with shorter cycle times and on optimized cycling operations."}
{"text": "Another postcombustion CO₂capture alternative is known as cryogenic capture.This process is commercially used to separate pure oxygen from air and works on the same principle as distillation.Different components in a gas go through phase change at different temperatures.When air is cooled,oxygen turns into a liquid before nitrogen—the other major component of air—and thus is separated from air.The same approach can be used for CO₂capture from flue gas because CO₂goes through its phase change before nitrogen.However,under ambient pressure,CO₂forms a solid instead of a liquid,complicating the removal of CO₂from the flue gas.Nonetheless,cryogenics is seen as a viable alternative because it is expected to have a lower energy demand than amine-based solvents,and it requires only electricity (instead of steam and electricity as amine-based solvents),making for an easier retrofit at existing power plants [21].Also, coolant may be generated during times of low electricity demand from the grid and stored for times of high demand,thus reducing the effective parasitic load of CO₂cap- ture (i.e.,more expensive electricity is sold to the grid instead of being used to generate coolant).Cryogenic capture can also be seen as an approach to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources,if electricity during times of oversupply due to high renewable production is used to generate coolant,so that power plants with CCS will not need to use their own—carbon-intensive-—electricity for capture [21].An additional benefit is that cryogenic capture can be operated to also remove SO,NOx,and mercury from the flue gas,thus combining all the flue gas treatment into a single process.The company SES Innovation has successfully conducted pilot tests to remove CO₂-—along with other contaminants-—from flue gas using their Cryogenic Carbon Capture technology. However,more research and development is required to demonstrate that this approach is viable at the industrial scale."}
{"text": "31.2.2 Precombustion capture\n\nThe concept of precombustion CO₂capture is to convert fossil fuel into CO₂and a fuel, which is carbon free(Fig.31.4).In the context of CCS,coal or natural gas is reacted with pure oxygen or steam to form syngas,which consists mainly of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.Then syngas is reacted with steam to convert carbon monoxide into CO₂and hydrogen.CO₂is then captured from the gas-—using similar approaches as in post- combustion capture-—leaving a hydrogen-rich gas that is used as low-carbon fuel in boilers,gas turbines,and fuel cells [22].While the gas separation technology (usually amine-based solvents)is very similar to postcombustion capture,the conditions are more favorable during precombustion capture.For one,the CO₂concentration after the steam shift is much higher than in flue gas and the pressure is higher (both favorable for capture)[23,24].Also,for the same amount of fossil fuel,the overall gas volume from syngas is smaller than the volume of flue gas because nitrogen from the air used during combustion is a major component of flue gas.However,power plants need to be spe- cifically designed to operate with this type of CO₂capture,so that retrofitting existing plants is not possible.IGCC and natural gas combined cycle are the two power plant designs amenable for precombustion CO₂capture.Unfortunately,capital costs are higher,and operations are more complex for these types of power plants than for conventional ones,so that very few have been constructed worldwide.Also,one of the most recent IGCC plants,Southern Company's Kemper County Energy Facility,was plagued with very high cost overruns during construction,and the plant is now fed with natural gas instead of by gasified coal,due to the low cost of natural gas.Therefore,more research and development coupled with a financial incentive to capture CO₂are needed for precombustion CO₂capture to become viable."}
{"text": "31.2.3 Oxyfuel combustion\n\nA second alternative to standard postcombustion CO₂capture is oxyfuel combustion.In this approach,the fossil fuel is combusted using pure oxygen instead of air [25].The advantage of using oxygen is that the volume of flue gas is lower than when using air,as a larger volume of air is required to deliver the oxygen necessary for combustion.Because of the higher concentration of CO₂in flue gas,CO₂capture becomes more efficient. There are several approaches to implement oxyfuel combustion.One approach is to substitute air with oxygen in a conventional boiler.This requires some modifications to a power plant,including adding a plant to capture oxygen from air,preventing ambient air from leaking into the combustion chamber,and recirculating some of the flue gas back into the combustion chamber to optimize the combustion.This approach has been successfully operated in industrial-scale pilot tests at Vattenfall's Schwarze Pumpe Pilot Plant(Germany),Total's Lacq Pilot Plant (France),CIUDEN's Technology Development Program Facilities (Spain),and COPL's Callide Oxyfuel Project (Australia) [25] ."}
{"text": "Amore advanced approach is called chemical looping,where a metal is reacted with oxygen to create an oxide,and that oxide is then reacted with the fossil fuel in a second reactor for combustion [14].The metal is then returned to the first reactor to be oxidized again.The combustion leads to a flue gas consisting of CO₂and water,and the water can be removed through condensation.Chemical looping has not yet been tested at an industrial-scale,but research and development into different metal oxides and operating conditions is ongoing.It should be noted that conventional oxyfuel combustion can be retrofit to existing power plants,as was demonstrated at COPL's Callide Oxyfuel Project [26],but chemical looping requires an overall different plant design."}
{"text": "The Allam cycle [27]is a recently developed variant of oxyfuel combustion,where supercritical CO₂(instead of steam)is used as working fluid in a closed-loop,high- pressure,low-pressure ratio Brayton cycle(Fig.31.5).From the perspective of CCS,one of the main advantages of the Allam cycle is that it results in a stream of pure CO₂at sufficient pressure and purity that it can be fed into a pipeline for transport to a usage or storage site.Therefore,no capture or compression is needed,eliminating the additional energy demand.In addition,replacing steam with CO₂as the working fluid significantly increases the efficiency of converting fuel to electricity.The overall energy efficiency is estimated to be around 59%,which would be on par or better than existing power plants that do not capture CO₂[27].Because of the high efficiency and relatively simple plant design,electricity prices from Allam cycle-based power plants are expected to be competitive with current prices.A25 MW pilot plant using the Allam cycle was completed in 2018 in La Porte,TX,and a 300 MW power plant is planned for the early 2020s [28]."}

{"text": "CO₂is transported via pipeline to the storage sites for the Snohvit Project(~170 km)and the Quest Project(~50 km).On the other hand,transport distances for capture opera- tions delivering CO₂for EOR tend to be much longer [7].While current CCS operations rely mainly on point-to-point pipelines,networks for trunk and feeder pipelines are likely the more desirable option for a potential economy-wide deployment of CCS in the future.Combining transport for multiple CCS operations reduces cost because the transport capacity of a pipeline increases with the square of the pipeline diameter,while the cost increases linearly with the diameter.In other words,one large diameter pipeline is more cost-effective than multiple smaller diameter pipelines with the same transport capacity."}
{"text": "Multiple CO₂pipelines have been built over the last several decades to transport mined CO₂to oil fields that are undergoing CO₂flooding as part of EOR.Therefore,both construction and operation of such pipelines is well understood.CO2 is usually com- pressed to its supercritical state before being fed into a pipeline to reduce its volume.It is also important to remove any moisture from CO₂,as\"wet\"CO₂is very corrosive. Corrosion is a serious issue in CO₂pipelines,as even small leaks can lead to decom- pression and subsequent expansion of CO₂.The expansion leads to Joule-Thompson cooling,and the low temperatures can significantly reduce the strength of the pipeline material.The combination of high pressure and weakened material can lead to a fracture propagating along the length of the pipeline over several meters.Pumping stations are distributed along a pipeline to ensure pressures remain high enough to maintain su- percritical CO₂because coexistence of supercritical and liquid CO₂may lead to cavita- tion,which is damaging to the pipeline.Insulation and heaters may also be necessary to maintain supercritical CO₂.If temperatures become too low,hydrates may form within the pipeline leading to flow constrictions and eventually pipeline shutdown."}

{"text": "As the mass of CO₂that needs to be stored is very large,the storage volume available at a storage site is a very important consideration.The mass of CO₂that can be poten- tially stored at a site is termed storage capacity.The porosity of the storage formation is the most important factor in determining storage capacity,as the injected CO₂will reside in the pore spaces.However,not the entire pore space will be filled with CO₂,due to formation properties and injection operational parameters.For instance,CO₂may be excluded from some parts of the formation due to capillary forces,and injection rates may be limited due to limits on allowable pressure increases.Predicting storage capacity is complicated by the lack of detailed knowledge of the subsurface and by the com- plexities of multiphase flow,and therefore,a simplified approach is commonly used to estimate storage capacity.One common approach is to determine the total available pore volume by multiplying the thickness and porosity of a storage formation by the area of the storage site.This volume is then modified by an efficiency factor and converted into a storage mass by multiplying by CO₂density at storage formation temperature and pressure conditions [46].The efficiency factor,which is usually well below 10%,is deter- mined through Monte Carlo simulations.This type of approach is termed a volumetric storage estimate because it is based on the available storage volume and is applicable over a range of storage sites.Dynamic storage estimates,on the other hand,are based on multiphase flow simulations of specific storage sites.While dynamic estimates require a more detailed site characterization and higher computational effort,effects of pressure limitations,number of injection wells,and other operational parameters are better represented than in volumetric estimates.Storage capacity is also estimated at the regional and country scale.One such example is the National Carbon Storage Atlas of the United States [47] produced by the Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory.This storage estimate is based on a volumetric approach and estimates a total storage capacity between 2.4 and 21.6 Gt in saline aquifers in North America (Fig.31.8).To produce dynamic storage capacity estimates at the country scale, simplified modeling approaches need to be used,as shown by the capacity estimate study of the continental United States by Szulczewski et al. [48] ."}
{"text": "geologic carbon storage is that the injection-induced pressure increase can lead to induced seismicity.CO₂injection causes the pressure in the storage formation to in- crease and thus changes the stress regime,leading to seismic events by reactivating existing fractures and faults or creating new ones.Unlike for the process of reinjection of coproduced water from oil fields,induced seismicity is not expected to be strong enough to be felt at the surface.The risk of felt-induced seismicity may be reduced by the proper choice of storage formation.For instance,Zhang et al.[50]found that injection into the formation directly above the underlying bedrock increases the potential for felt seismic events.Caprock is usually stiffer than the rocks in the storage formation and is thus more prone to fracturing.Therefore,injection rates are often limited by regulatory re- quirements to remain below a threshold pressure,termed fracture pressure."}
{"text": "Migration of water from the storage formation can also be problematic,especially if storage formation water reaches aquifers used as drinking water resource.The water quality in drinking water aquifers may be impaired by high salinity and other contam- inants potentially present in the storage formation.However,studies have shown that water migration through the caprock is not an issue [52],as the caprock permeability is low and any intervening aquifers act as buffers.Similar to CO₂leakage,leakage of for- mation water is most likely to occur along concentrated leakage pathways(e.g.,aban- doned wells and faults).However,unlike CO₂,water is only migrating vertically due to pressure gradients,so that intervening aquifers act as buffers,dissipating the pressure increase and thus stopping water migration [44]."}
{"text": "One of the main concerns regarding leakage is that locations,depth,and effective permeability of concentrated leakage pathways are often uncertain;faults may be too small to be detected by seismic surveys,and records for abandoned wells may have been lost(or wells were never recorded).Field measurements of abandoned wells have been conducted both with direct measurements through the wellbore [53,54] and through indirect measurements of gas leakage rates [55].However,a simulation study of leakage through abandoned wells penetrating several permeable formations found that for the range of permeabilities determined by the field measurements and expected spatial density and completion depth of abandoned wells,leakage of CO₂from the storage formation to the atmosphere is well below leakage rates that would negate the climate change mitigation impact of CCS [44].This suggests that leakage through abandoned wells is unlikely to be a major risk at most GCS sites."}

{"text": "In addition to the industrial-scale projects described above,there have been several pilot-scale injections over the past decades.The US Department of Energy funded several pilot-scale injections through their Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships program [61],such as the Illinois Basin Decatur Project in Decatur,IL(1 Mt of CO₂injected)and the Anthropogenic Test in Mobile County,MS (0.1 Mt of CO₂injected).Pilot-scale in- jections have also been conducted in Germany at the Ketzin site [62],in Japan at the Nagaoka [63]and Tomakomai [64]sites (Fig.31.9),in China at the Shenhua Ordos CCS Project [65],and in Australia at the Otway Project [66].The overall goal for these pilot- scale injections was to gather experience with CO₂injection and to develop and test monitoring technologies that can detect CO₂in the storage formation.As climate change mitigation was not the direct goal,the overall amount of injected CO2 is low."}

{"text": "For many of the metals required for future energy technologies,they are produced as by-products during the refining of metals such as Zn,Cu,and Pb-meaning that they are not a priority for mining companies since they are rarely paid for them in their con- centrates,and of typically minor interest to metals smelting and refining companies as they represent low value compared to the primary metals.This means that there is minimal data published on metals such as In or Te,since they are such minor value and small markets.Unfortunately,minimal data and concentrated supply are often confused with risks of being unable to meet future demands-but in reality,lack of data does not mean lack of resources or potential supply."}

{"text": "Similarly,Mudd and Jowitt [20]show that in 2013,Canada had 76.82 Mt Zn in resources-still more than cumulative production by that time.The main challenge in Canada is that there are no longer any annual assessments of reserves and resources (the last year being 2010),leaving a large data gap and making it easy to perceive a lack of data as resource depletion.Clearly Canada is not short of potentially mineable Cu or Zn. As above,these long-term trends reinforce the optimism that the resources of primary metals are well established to support growth in specialty metals derived as by-products. A global distribution of estimated indium resources is shown in Fig.33. 5,also validating the case for optimism."}
{"text": "patterns remains unclear,but could be related to changing technologies used in re- fineries (especially Cu)which makes less by-product metals economically recoverable, or possibly declining concentrations in source concentrates (especially since some ele- ments such as Cd are toxic and managing associated wastes is often expensive,with concentrates containing elevated levels attracting a penalty paid for them).A compli- cating issue is that detailed mass balance estimates on a global basis are not published for most of the specialty metals,although for indium it is known that considerably more indium exists in Zn(and Cu,Pb,and Sn)concentrates which is not extracted in refineries since they have no indium recovery circuit [24].Furthermore,global mine production data still does not include numerous countries which are known to produce them (e.g., United States and Australia and Cd,Ge,Se,Te;numerous other countries also produce Ga,Ge,Se,Te,but do not report statistics).Understanding global mass flows of the numerous specialty metals from mining through smelting and refining is a fundamen- tally important area which needs much greater research."}

{"text": "Concerns about environmental risks are often a key basis for concerns by local communities,sometimes leading to sustained opposition to existing or proposed mining project.This can lead to some projects losing\"social licence to operate\"-essentially the support of a local community-—or in more extreme cases failure to win approval or even withdrawal of existing permits.Other social concerns can relate to culturally important sites,especially indigenous sacred sites,or socioeconomic issues(especially competition for land use and water rights).Examples include Resolution,Crandon,or Pebble in the United States,Tambo Grande or Minas Conga in Peru,Kodu (Mount Bini) in Papua New Guinea,Kemmess,New Prosperity,Ajax or Kerr-Sulphurets-Mitchell (KSM)in Canada.Increasingly,international financiers are looking to ensure that new projects they fund meet the expectations for governance,environmental management, and social license-—and especially the United Nations'recently developed Sustainable Development Goals."}

{"text": "The International Renewable Energy Agency(IRENA) has published in their REmap series [52]a global roadmap toward 2050 to fulfill the Paris Agreement.IRENA projects a massive rise of electricity share in total final energy demand from present 20%-50%in the year 2050.The electricity supply share of renewables is expected to be 86%,with remaining 10%for fossil fuels(mainly fossil gas)and 4%for nuclear power.The energy- related GHG emissions are expected to decline by 70%compared to present levels to- ward 2050,which is not yet what is needed according to the 1.5℃ target of the Paris Agreement.IRENA also finds that renewable electricity will help to reduce GHG emis- sions in the sectors heat and transport by about 60%,whereas bioenergy shall play a major role for the harder to abate segments [53]in the energy system.Most important for the policy efforts needed for the transition,IRENA finds substantial cobenefits for additional GDP growth,creation of new jobs and human health,which should massively support respective decision-making of policy-makers.IRENA expects annual solar PV capacity additions of 300 GW in 2030,growing to 360 GW in 2050,which can be compared to about 100 GW annual capacity installations in the year 2017 and 2018.They assume 200 GW annual installations of wind energy in 2030 and 240 GW in 2050, compared to about 54 GW in the present.Total cumulative installed solar PV and wind energy capacity is projected to reach 8519 and 6044 GW in 2050,respectively.IRENA also projects a massive growth in electric vehicles and electric heat pumps.The REmap 2050 scenario implies a 64%reduction in fossil fuel demand compared to the present, which is not yet ambitious enough,given the requirement for zero GHG emissions in 2050 for the 1.5℃ target.The entire trajectory leads to cumulative GHG emissions of 827 GtCOzeq in 2015-20 and annual GHG emissions of 9.8 GtCOzeq in the year 2050, compared to allowed 576 GtCO2eq(67%)in total for a 1.5℃,which shows drastically that a the REmap 2050 shall be further improved."}

Attractive overall economics are shown by several researchers in various studies,but on global level by Teske et al.[60,61],Jacobson et al.[78,79],Breyer et al.[40,80].100%RE studies published up to the year 2018 have been comprehensively summarized by Hansen et al.[81]showing a strongly growing research field,which covers increasingly all energy sectors but in particular the power sector.The last frontier in RE opposition is energetic sustainability and resource availability for a global 100%RE system.For the case of energetic sustainability,recent insights and discussion showed that major con- cerns are grounded well for the overall energy system and the discussion on fossil CCS vs RE as shown by Sgouridis et al.[82,83]and by Raugei et al.[84]and Kurland and Benson [85] for the case of solar PV,which is also based on the fundamental insight of energetic learning of solar PV [86].The resource availability for a global 100%RE system is increasingly investigated,such as by Teske et al.[61],and may lead to new insights for constraints of specific technologies.Most critical and hardest to abate material may be lithium from today's level of insights,which should induce major research programmes to find additional classes of materials for highly efficient and low-cost batteries in future."}

{"text": "Batteries will be the most important electricity storage technology,in stationary [40] but also mobile applications in the transport sector [80,214].For stationary storage,Breyer et al.[80]projected a demand for 74 TWhcap,much higher than Teske et al.[61]and Jacobson et al.[79].This has to do with the different methods of optimization and simu- lation models,but also the different findings in solar PV and CSP which should also lead to different total system cost.This cannot be investigated in detail due to different standards in cost reporting.Most batteries will be needed in the transport sector,mainly for vehicles on roads.Indications get stronger that the dominant powertrain for road vehicles will be battery electric,also due to the fact that the competing hydrogen-based fuel cell electric vehicle(FCEV)route is only about half that efficient from electricity generation to wheels than the alternative of battery electric vehicles (BEV).The dominant battery technology is expected in the near-to midterm lithium-ion,driven by very high growth rates and high learning rates [215].Batteries provide valuable flexibility to the energy system [216],in overcoming the day-night cycle of solar PV,smart charging of battery electric vehicles and vehicle-to-grid (V2G)services [112].The cobalt demand for present battery technology may be fully mitigated,but the lithium demand may limit this battery technology,so that alternative material classes should be developed,rather sooner than later."}
{"text": "Heat supply for space heating may be provided in future mainly by heat pumps [80,217];however,improved building standards and higher renovation rates are needed for a faster phase-out of fossil-based fuel solutions in areas of lacking district heating systems.Heat supply for district heating systems may be more diverse [218,219], spanning a range from combined heat and power(CHP)plants,to geothermal heat plants,larger heat pumps and to solar heat solutions.Heat pumps in residential appli- cations can also serve for domestic hot water demand and they can be coupled to solar PV systems for smaller and larger buildings [41,220].The advantage of heat pumps is the decoupling of a specific electricity source,so that wind electricity can be used during winter times and solar PV can support in autumn and spring.To avoid peak loads in the grid,some thermal energy storage capacity should be added to enable more flexibility."}
{"text": "34.5 Research gaps for a future energy system\n\nMuch insights have been obtained during the past decade of 100%RE system research [81].The latest insight of Breyer et al.[80]that a cost-neutral transition to a 100% renewable and zero GHG emission energy system by 2050 within a 1.5℃ pathway can be achieved without any need for risk technologies,and can be used as a basis for next-level investigations.This new level of insight is highly important since previous insights in the IAM community regularly required either fossil CCS or nuclear energy,or both for ambitious climate mitigation pathways [6,250],but the fast decline in cost of renewable energyis fundamentally changing the situation [46],which is still faced with some inertia in adoption in the IAM community [48].However,the value of 100%RE systems is started to be acknowledge in the latest SR 1.5 report of the IPCC [6],whereas 100%RE scenarios from the IAMs community have not yet proposed."}
{"text": "There are not yet many studies on cross-border and cross-sectoral integration for the entire energy system and larger economic rims so that the various types of flexibility and their respective value could be better understood.Brown et al.[103]have carried out one of the very first studies of this kind for the case of Europe and they find a cost reduc- tion of 25%for cross-border integration,28%for cross-sectoral integration and 37%for a cross-border and cross-sectoral integration.This result has to be confirmed by additional teams,also in energy transition studies and also for more economic rims in the world."}
{"text": "The energy system models (ESMs)are not yet well enough developed in order to simulate global trade for synthetic fuels and chemical.It is expected that this additional flexibility will lead to further cost reductions in global-local energy system transition scenarios.Future research has to shed light on this highly relevant aspect.The conse- quences will be drastic for several industries,first of all,the petrochemical industry, since the global value chain may be reallocated to sites of excellent solar and wind energy resources,such as Atacama Desert,Patagonia,Maghreb,Horn of Africa,Western Australia,and others.The technical and economic development of liquefied hydrogen (LH₂)will be very important for several industries,but in particular for the global steel industry,which will need access to least-cost hydrogen for hydrogen direct reduced iron [226]as a substitute for the coal-based conventional iron making process.If low-cost LH₂transport and supply options were available,then sites of excellent solar and wind resources could supply the hydrogen and traditional steel mill sites could continue their operation.However,if low-cost LH₂routes were not available,then it may be beneficial to remove the existing industrial sites for iron ore to iron conversion to sites of excellent solar and wind energy resources,with respective impacts on global value chains,and jobs.First research indicates that LH₂transport will be possible [251],but more investigation will be needed."}
{"text": "ESMs and IAMs have their strengths and weaknesses,but a combination of the strengths of both may reduce the weaknesses,so that a new level of integrated insights may be possible.The key strength of the IAMs is the link of the global energy system to other planetary systems of land-use,oceans,biosphere,cryosphere,climate,etc.,but their major weakness is the poor temporal and geospatial resolution,which practically blocks all flexibility options in energy systems.The outstanding strength of ESMs is the ability to model in very high temporal and spatial resolution,but for the price ofignoring all aspects outside the energy system.A direct link ofIAMs and ESMs should enable a new level of insights [81].A first test bed for such a collaboration may be combined research efforts to find least-cost pathways toward real climate stability,which may be achieved in rebalancing within our planetary boundaries,in a 350 ppm CO₂and 1.0℃ target at the end of the 21st century."}

There may be further elements,which have been not yet identified to be limited and critical for the energy transition ahead."}

{"text": "15.4.1 Life-cycle assessment\n\nHydropower projects have a very long lifetime,up to 80 years or more [1].To evaluate total costs and benefits,environmental effects,energy efficiency,and the impact on global greenhouse gas(GHG)emissions,it is important to consider the whole life cycle for a project incuding investigation,planning,construction,operation,maintenance, refurbishing,and eventually decommissioning.LCOE method discussed in the cost section is based on a life-cycle assessment of economic performance.In addition,two other important performance parameters can be mentioned:GHG emission and EPR."}
{"text": "15.4.2 Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe majority of life-cycle GHG emission estimates for hydropower lies between about 4 and 14 g(CO₂eq)(kWh)-¹,but under certain scenarios there is a risk of much larger quantities of GHG emissions [1].This typical range can be compared with 1000 g(CO₂eq) (kWh)-¹for coal power plants,800 for oil power plants and 500 for gas power plants. Other renewables also have very low GHG emissions,comparable or slightly higher than hydro (Fig.15.4 )."}
{"text": "15.4.3 Energy payback ratio\n\nThe energy payback ratio(EPR)is defined as the ratio of total energy produced during a system's normal life span divided by the energy required to build,maintain,and fuel it.A high ratio indicates good environmental performance.If a system has EPR close to unity,it consumes nearly as much energy as it generates.Hydropower has the highest EPR of all electricity generation technologies,with ratios ranging from 170 to 267 for RoR plants and 205-280 for storage plants.This can be compared with typical ratios between 1.6 and 7 for fossil fuels,18-34 for large wind turbines,and 14-16 for nuclear power plants(Fig.15. 5)."}
{"text": "Many studies were reviewed and summarized in Ref.[1].Most of the studies have focused only on the effect of change in river flow volume,and few have studied and quantified the effects of the other three bullet points."}
{"text": "In Ref.[12]the regional and global changes in hydropower generation for the existing hydropower system were investigated,based on a global assessment of climate change and its effect on river flow by 2050 [13].At high latitude and in most of the tropics, climate models mostly predict increasing precipitation and runoff,while in the mid- latitudes,the prediction is that precipitation will generally decrease.Regions with decreasing water resources and decreasing hydropower generation can be found around the Mediterranean,in Southern Africa,in Australia,and in Central and Western America. Regions with increasing water resources and increasing hydropower generation can be found in Northern Europe,most of Russia,East Asia,East Africa,Canada,and parts of South America.The global effect on runoff and hydropower was found to be small and probably slightly positive [12]."}
{"text": "15.5 Cost issues\n\nCost for hydropower projects is very site specific and can therefore vary significantly from one project to another.The main cost components are(1)upfront investment cost (capital cost),(2)operation and maintenance cost(O&M),and (3)decommissioning cost.LCOE includes all these cost elements for the entire lifetime of the project and is usually given in units of US c(kWh)-¹.LCOE for hydropower depends on these cost components and also on (4)capacity factor,(5)lifetime of project,and (6)cost of capital (discount rate)."}
{"text": "These are based on data from a large number of recent projects,compiled by IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency).They show the spread and trend in cost for the most important renewable technologies the last few years (2010-16).Hydropower is, on average,still the technology with lowest average cost,followed by onshore wind, geothermal,and bioenergy.A closer look into IRENAs cost database reveals that small hydro generally has a higher cost than large hydro and that there are substantial regional differences.Regions such as Europe and North America,where a larger share of available resources have been developed,show a higher cost than in regions with large untapped potential,such as East Asia and South America."}
{"text": "part load efficiency.The ability to rapidly change output in response to system needs without suffering large decreases in efficiency makes hydropower plants well suited to providing the balancing services called regulation and load following.Hydropower can also provide the ability to restore a power station to operation without relying on the electric power transmission network(black start capability)."}
{"text": "In Denmark and Germany,for example,the high level of variable wind is already being balanced by flexible hydropower generation in Norway,connected through subsea power cables.Studies have shown that this balancing capacity can be increased by constructing new PSH's in Norway.This can be done using only existing reservoirs,and at least 20 GW of such projects has been identified [16].To utilize them fully,the grid connection between Norway and Denmark/Germany/UK needs to be strengthened with at least 10-15 GW,compared with existing connections."}
{"text": "The important role for hydropower for balancing other renewables,and providing energy storage,is increasingly recognized.The transition toward cleaner and more sustainable energy systems will require a significant increase in power system flexibility to maintain a reliable and continuous service when faced with potentially rapid changes in supply or demand [8,17]."}
{"text": "15.7 Future deployment\n\nBecause only about 25%of the technical potential and less than 50%of the economic potential have been developed,the prospects for further development are good.Many estimates of future deployment of hydropower have been made,almost all predict a substantial increase globally."}
{"text": "The IPCC's fourth assessment report (AR4)assumed that hydro could contribute to 17%of global electricity supply by 2030,or 5382 TWh a- ¹.The IEA's world energy outlook 2010 reference scenario projected 5232 TWh a-¹of hydro by 2030.Some hy- dropower industry forecasts predict an even higher market potential of 8700 TWh a-¹to be reached by 2050 [8].The most recent analysis by IEA [14]shows that hydropower could double its contribution by 2050,reaching 2000 GW of global capacity and over 7000 TWh a- ¹.The bulk of this growth would come from the large plants in emerging economies and developing countries(Fig.15.7)."}
{"text": "by the end of 2015,at least 173 countries had introduced renewable energy targets [1]. This investment direction in prioritizing renewable energy production is safeguarded by international bodies and legislation.For instance,the European Union (EU)in its Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union has clearly marked its energy priorities for transition to a low-carbon,secure,and competitive economy.The“Clean Energy for all Europeans\"package sets the implementation milestones for the Member States' colegislation toward the security and integration of EU's energy market,energy effi- ciency,and decarbonization of the electricity sector [7]."}
{"text": "nonrenewable ones.It can be noted that the weighted average cost of all the renewables is competing with the cost of nonrenewables.At the same time,however,the cost variance of renewables is larger than the nonrenewables,something that can raise un- certainties during the design of a project.Nevertheless,by 2020 these costs are expected to drop below the nonrenewables [8],and therefore,more investment is expected, especially for wind and solar technologies."}
{"text": "16.2 Wind among the renewables\n\nWind power is the second largest renewable resource,behind hydropower,and is one of the fastest growing power sources.The main advantages of wind as a power source are that the associated infrastructure (i.e.,wind turbines,power stations,etc.)is quick to install,it is scalable(i.e.,a wind farm can consist of a couple turbines or hundreds based on the needs they cover),and it has a low-carbon footprint thought out the life cycle of the project.Namely,the power capacity of wind has increased exponentially from 6.1 GW in 1996 to 591.5W in 2018,accounting for both onshore and offshore in- stallations.Back in 2007,wind power generated 1%of the electricity in the world,almost all coming from onshore wind farms [9].Now this percentage has grown to almost 4%, and out of the total wind power capacity,3.9%is produced by offshore wind farms. Fig.16.7 shows the cumulative global capacity of wind power for the period 1998-2018. The data are obtained from GWEC."}
{"text": "between onshore and offshore wind farms is because of the harsh environment condi- tions that offshore wind farms are built in,which results in an increase of the costs of installation and maintenance."}
{"text": "All the scenarios regarding the future growth of wind energy look positive.More specifically,a moderate scenario by Global Wind Energy Council [11]suggests that the global wind capacity will increase to approximately 800 GW by 2020,rising to 1700 GW by 2030,and 4000 GW by 2050,which translates to a contribution of around 20%-25% toward the total energy needs worldwide.Key drivers to the projected growth of wind power should be the support from governments and the rapid improvement in wind turbine technology."}
{"text": "16.3 Offshore wind power\n\nDuring the past few years,power generation from offshore wind has emerged as one of the most promising ways to attain increased energy sustainability.Therefore,large proportion of the future projection scenarios,regarding the wind power growth,is ex- pected to be offshore.Offshore wind power is nothing more than the evolution of onshore as a way to maximize the capacity for power generation.Because going offshore is considered the future of wind power,the next sections will mainly focus on different aspects of offshore wind power."}
{"text": "The main parts of an offshore wind farm are the wind turbines,the cables,and the substations [13].The turbines are the most important part.Wind turbines are nothing more than generators that convert the wind power into electric power.For economic reasons,such as reducing planning,construction,and maintenance costs,many wind turbines are installed at the same time in one location.The electric power produced by the turbines is then transferred through cable arrangements to an offshore substation. There the voltage of the electric power is stabilized and maximized and then exported to shore.Through an onshore substation,the offshore electric power is added to the main electricity grid.Fig.16.12 schematically presents a typical layout of an offshore wind farm,with all of its key components annotated.For further details on offshore wind farms and wind turbines,the readers are referred to Chapter 1 of Bhattacharya,2019 [14]."}
{"text": "16.3.4 Wind turbines\n\nThe vital part of an offshore wind farm is the array of wind turbines.As it was mentioned before,wind turbines are the actual devices responsible for converting the kinetic energy of the wind into electric power,a fact that explains their high cost.Just on their own, wind turbine structures account for 30%-40%of the capital cost and therefore play a crucial role in the viability of the whole wind farm."}
{"text": "1970s,the research on wind turbine technologies got intensified,and major steps have been taken since."}
{"text": "Wind turbines vary in sizes,designs,and power output.Nowadays,the most common configuration of a wind turbine system consists of a three-bladed rotor driving a hori- zontally mounted generator.The basic elements of a wind turbine are the rotor,the nacelle,the tower,the transition piece,and the foundation.The different components of a wind turbine are shown in Fig.16.13."}
{"text": "the share of each foundation type in Europe for 2018.The main reason why monopile foundation is selected for an offshore project is the lower cost of construction and installation.However,as these are limited to approximately 30m of water depth,there is a need to look into different types of foundations to access locations further from shore and in deeper water depths,which subsequently mean higher wind speeds."}
{"text": "an offshore wind farm is heavily influence by its LCOE.Therefore,for offshore wind energy to be a competitive source of energy,all the associated costs must significantly drop."}
{"text": "To assess the total cost of an offshore wind farm,it is essential to break down the whole life cycle of the project into phases.Almost every construction project is composed out of three phases:investment,operation,and decommissioning.Out of all the phases,the phase of investment is the most capital-intensive.For the case of an offshore wind farm,the investment phase includes the development,the design,and fabrication of all the components and their installation.The phase of investment can last up to 9 years,with most of this time spent in planning and obtaining consent,activities that can take up to 5 years on their own.After the investment,the wind farms are ex- pected to produce electricity to the grid for at least 20 years.During this operation phase, the project must work without any problem;therefore,regular maintenance is required to keep the downtime minimum and also prolong the life span of the whole project. When the operation phase is over,there is the decommissioning phase where there can be two options:the entire project is dismantled and disposed,which marks the end of the farm's life cycle,or the farm is repowered with new turbines and a new life cycle begins.The life cycle of an offshore wind farm (along with all the different phases)is illustrated in Fig.16.17 [38,39]."}
{"text": "operation.On the other hand,OPEX can be defined as the ongoing cost,either one-time ore recurring related to the operation of the asset.Both can further divided into more detailed costs.For example,CAPEX can be divided into three main categories.These are the turbine costs (including all the wind turbine components),the construction costs (including foundation,electrical infrastructure,assembly,and installation costs),and the development costs (including the planning,insurance,construction,and contingency financing and decommissioning costs).Similarly,OPEX includes two main categories of costs,which are the operation and the maintenance costs.The contribution of these two costs toward the total cost is approximately 75%for CAPEX and 25%for OPEX,as shown in Fig.16.18 [40]."}
{"text": "Comparing head-to-head,the total expenditure of an offshore wind farm with an onshore one highlights the big difference in cost.Namely,the cost of an offshore wind farm is approximately twice the cost of an onshore.Interestingly,the ratio of CAPEX and OPEX toward the total cost is similar for both cases.Just another indication of the dif- ference in cost can be found at the cost of the wind turbine toward the total CAPEX of a wind farm project.For an onshore wind farm,most of the capital cost,approximately 65%,is in the turbine itself,whereas for an offshore wind farm,it accounts close to 30% of the total capital cost.The breakdown and comparison of the total expenditure and CAPEX for an onshore and an offshore wind farm are also presented in Fig.16.18."}
{"text": "other words,the wind farms on the one hand must gain access to sites further from shore and consequently in deeper waters,where the wind is faster and more consistent,and on the other hand,they should achieve a significant cost reduction."}
{"text": "● Electrical connections: There two different types of connections;the HVAC(high- voltage alternating current)and the HVDC (high-voltage direct current).The main parameters to consider,when choosing connections,are the rated power and the\n\ndistance to shore.Currently,most offshore wind farms use HVAC type of connec- tions,and only 14%use HVDC.However,as the offshore farms move further from shore,the HVDC technology is likely to be a necessity because they have less trans- mission losses for longer distances.At present,the cost of the HVDC technology is higher,but it is expected that the benefits will compensate for the higher costs."}

[42].Further details of the dynamics of wind turbine structures together with the effects of foundation can be found in Bhattacharya [43]."}
{"text": "ASIDE:One may argue,had there been few offshore wind turbines operating,the disaster may have been averted or the scale of damages could have certainly been reduced.The wind turbines could have run the emergency cooling system and prevented the reactor meltdown.In this context,it is interesting to note that there are plans to replace the Fukushima NPP by a floating wind farm.The project is in an advanced stage, involving a 2MW semisub floating turbine,which has been operational for few years,see Fig.16.24.An innovative 7MW oil pressure drive-type wind turbine on a three-column semisub floater has recently been tested."}

{"text": "It can be argued that the present interest in tidal current energy started at the Corran Narrows in Loch Linnhe in 1994 with the testing of a buoyant tethered device by IT Power Ltd.(former parent company of Marine Current Turbines Ltd.,who inherited the fruits ofthis work)."}
{"text": "Considerable sums of UK taxpayers money have gone into the development of tidal energy devices,and much of the knowledge gained has remained shrouded under corporate confidentiality resulting in many of the manufacturers repeating the same mistakes as other manufacturers and thereby slowing the universal knowledge base.No new industry has ever gone from small prototypes to full-size industrial products without building practical,economically viable versions that generate sales;even wind turbines took some years to cross the 1MW barrier.It is therefore argued that until the tidal energy industry builds and deploys hundreds of cost-effective devices in the range of 300-500 kW and demonstrates their commercial value,the 2 MW devices will struggle to make a strong business case;the industry must go back to move forward."}
{"text": "17.2 Tidal current drivers\n\nThe tidal systems that move the oceans are regular,reliable,highly complex,gravita- tional,centrifugal,and resonance-driven systems and should not be confused with other oceanic flows such as the Gulf Stream and the Global Conveyor,which rely principally on thermohaline-induced density variations for their motive force.That being said,the two types of system do interact in certain locations around the globe.In addition,the North Atlantic and South Atlantic gyres are examples of nontidal currents that are driven by their respective hemispherical trade winds [2]and,as such,are repositories of solar heat energy and not gravitationally induced kinetic energy."}
{"text": "The Moon is responsible for the largest proportion of the tidal forces applied to the Earth,but it is not independent on its influence,as not only does the Sun affect the tidal forces but also the Moon's own tidal influence is modified by the Sun's gravitational field.These cycles are themselves modified by the evective influence of the Sun and occasionally other planets within our solar system,depending on their relative positions."}
{"text": "The tidal waves created by the Earth/Moon/Sun system propagate as long waves,and their speed is dependent on water depth.A typical wave in an average ocean of 4000 m depth would travel at about 200 ms-¹.This compares with the equatorial lunar speed of about 450 ms-¹,thus demonstrating that the Earth's oceans simply cannot keep up with the lunar track.These tidal waves,being of astronomical origin,have no connection with a tsunami,an event that is often erroneously referred to as a tidal wave."}
{"text": "Tidal current frequencies and amplitudes can be analyzed and predicted using the same mathematical techniques as tidal heights.The process of obtaining the initial data from tidal currents is more difficult than that of reading tidal heights,but the intro- duction of advanced subsea digital electronics has made acquisition of substantial quantities of high-quality tidal current velocity data relatively straightforward and inexpensive.Beyond the relatively simplistic velocities given in tidal atlases,all tidal currents will behave in their own idiosyncratic way,sometimes with large temporal and spatial variations in the flow behavior throughout the 18.6 year cydle.Meter length-scale vortices and turbulence within the system render many highly energetic areas unusable for energy extraction."}
{"text": "17.2.3 Coriolis forces\n\nAlthough named after Coriolis(1835)who developed the area of acceleration in a rotating system [3],the actual concept is due to Laplace [4]in his original study of tides in 1775.The concept can be explained thus."}
{"text": "Most of the Atlantic coastal tides are semidiurnal in nature,so the diurnal inequality that is readily seen in a mixed tide is quite small in tides of this area.This is largely due to the fact that the dimensions of the Atlantic basin give it a response that favors the semidiurnal frequencies.The Pacific Ocean,being much larger,responds to both diurnal and semidiurnal frequencies,and this gives a substantial diurmal inequality to the tides of California and British Columbia on the west coast of the North American continent."}

{"text": "If a turbine were to be mounted on this monopile,the differences in flow pressure experienced by the blades as they rotate would be substantial and potentially damaging."}
{"text": "The flow in the Pentland Firth is highly complex and notoriously difficult to predict, being very sensitive to meteorological influences in addition to the strong tidal forces.A contemporaneous account of a storm in December 1862 has the east-going flow clearing the vertical cliffs on the west of Stroma and depositing seaweed and shipwrecks on the top,a lift of 25m [12]."}
{"text": "Tidal device proposals are plentiful,though few have actually been tested at sea,so, due to limited space availability,this work will discuss a selection of those devices that have been tested at sea.Much peripheral information on tidal current devices is readily available on the Internet,and many of them claim to be the“World Leader”in tidal power;however,little performance information is publicly available for many of these devices."}

The turbine geometry needs to be sufficiently robust to operate efficiently within a broad tolerance range,otherwise the surface geometry of a tidal stream device relative to the flow is totally dependent on the accuracy of the support structures'installation.The supporting structure must be capable of maintaining the optimal orientation of the turbine relative to the flow as poor positional control may place unforeseen loads on the device,which in turn will place additional demands on the support structure and moorings.It is ultimately the moorings that will control the support structure position and therefore the position of the turbine relative to the flow."}

{"text": "17.4.2 Suction/drilled/driven pile anchors\n\nSuction anchors and piled foundations form the principal methodology of installation for existing offshore platforms,and it therefore seems appropriate at first glance to use them for tidaldevices.Suction anchors require adepth ofsediment,thequality of whichmay varyfrom soft silt tostiff clay,which will give sufficient depth of insertion to generate the resistive forces necessary for the anchor to hold reliably under operational conditions.These anchors are potentially applicable to sites where the tidal stream flow is relatively slow,and sufficient depth of sediment exists,but high velocity channels (where the flow exceeds 2ms-¹regu- larly)aregenerally scoured clean.Suctionpile anchors arerelatively quickand cheap toinstall in situations where a high degree of positional accuracy of the anchor is not critical to the installation.An analysis of suction pile capabilities is given in Ref.[19]."}
{"text": "The limiting value for a drilled and grouted pile is the crushing strength of the grout and its surrounding geology.When the flow applies a lateral pressure to the turbine,the pile is required to provide the reaction force at its junction with the geology.A well-fitted pile distributes much of the pressure evenly over its grouted interface,but there still exist areas of very high stress,and the reliability of the installation depends on the crushing strength of the grout and immediate geology at these points.Of course,at the reversal of the flow,the opposite side of the socket is subjected to similar loading.See Fig. 17.6."}

{"text": "17.5 Biofouling\n\nAny object submerged or partially submerged in seawater will attract the growth of or- ganisms on its surface,creating opportunities for corrosion,increased drag on support structures,and reduced hydrodynamic efficiency of the actuator surfaces.The light in- tensity at different depths will influence the species and quantity of organisms,as will the temperature of the tidal stream itself,which will often have different thermal char- acteristics to the surrounding mass of water.In addition to the increased drag,biofouling is often the cause of sensor failure [20]and can initiate a new food chain around the structure,increasing the probability of fish bites and other predatory attacks on cables and hydraulic lines.Increased levels of equipment protection are required and the in- hibition of biofouling is likely to pose considerable environmental difficulties given the toxic nature of commonly available antifouling agents."}
{"text": "Over 2000 biofouling species have been identified and a highly detailed review of biofouling is given in Ref.[21].The tidal stream energy industry,given its green heritage and environmentally friendly image,is unlikely to wish to pursue highly toxic coatings that are indiscriminately harmful to the marine environment,such as tributyl tin self- polishing copolymers.These coatings are estimated to cover 70%of the world's ship- ping fleet but have been shown to cause defective shell growth in oysters,sexual disorders in dog whelks,and reduction of immunological defenses in fish."}

{"text": "Photovoltaic systems that enable the direct conversion of solar energy to electricity are currently among the fastest growing energy segments.After 30 years of development, photovoltaics (PVs)has been recognized as a renewable energy technology that has the potential to contribute significantly to future energy supply.Cumulative installed power yearly growths were on an average more than 40%in the period from 2000 to 2018,and in 2018,the global cumulative PV power installed has reached a level of 512 GWp. Annually installed power reached nearly 110 GWp in 2018,and it is expected to grow in future,while the cost of electrical energy produced by PV systems decreased close to the level of energy produced by conventional sources."}

{"text": "The Earth goes around the Sun in an elliptic orbit with the Sun at one of the foci,as shown in Fig.18.1 .The plane containing this orbit is called the eciptic plane,and the Earth takes to complete this orbit in 1 year.The eccentricity of the ecliptic is very small, only 1.7%.Often,it is described as a circular orbit with the radius ro=1.496×10⁸km (the mean value of the distance).Because of the orbit eccentricity,the average value of extraterrestrial irradiance (the radiant solar energy flow per unit area perpendicular to the direction of radiation spreading to the outer surface of the Earth's atmosphere) slightly varies,as shown in Fig.18.2.The variations of extraterrestrial irradiance during the year are less than 3.3%.The mean value of extraterrestrial irradiance is called the solar constant,and its value is GBO=1367 Wm-² ."}
{"text": "Besides the movement round the Sun,the Earth also spins once a day on the polar axis,which has a constant angle of 23.45 degrees with the ecliptic plane,as demonstrated in Fig.18.1 .The angle between the equatorial plane and a straight line connected the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth is the solar declination,δ,which is constantly changing over the year from -23.45 degrees at the winter solstice to +23.45 degrees at the summer solstice."}
{"text": "The extraterrestrial radiation varies regularly,daily and yearly,due to the motion of the Sun.These variations can be theoretically determined just by geometrical con- siderations [1-5]."}
{"text": "Sunlight falling on Earth enters the atmosphere consisting mainly from nitrogen and oxygen at an altitude of several hundred km from the Earth's surface.These atmospheric gases absorb solar ultraviolet and X-rays and ionize (ionosphere)at elevations above 60 km.Ata height of 20-30 km,there is a layer with a high ozone content(ozonosphere), where ultraviolet radiation is absorbed.Below,in the troposphere,solar radiation is absorbed by ozone,water vapor,CO₂,dust,and water drops in the clouds."}
{"text": "The dependence of the incident radiation spectrum on the atmospheric mass coef- ficient is shown in Fig.18.6."}
{"text": "Passing through the Earth's atmosphere,the solar radiation is modified by interaction with components present there.Clouds reflect radiation,and ozone,oxygen,carbon dioxide,and water vapor have significant absorption at several specific spectral bands. Water droplets and suspended dust also cause scattering.The result of all these pro- cesses is the decomposition of the solar radiation incident on a receiver at the Earth's surface into clearly differentiated components."}
{"text": "Direct(or beam)radiation component of irradiance Gp,consisting of beams of light\n\nthat are not reflected or scattered,reaches the surface in a straight line from the Sun."}
{"text": "Diffuse radiation component of irradiance Gp,coming from the whole sky apart from the Sun's disc,is the radiation scattered toward the receiver."}
{"text": "In real terrestrial conditions,solar irradiance received on a collector depends on latitude,day of the year,slope or tilt angle,surface azimuth angle,time of the day,and the angle of incident radiation.There are also random variations of irradiance caused by climatic conditions:cloud cover,dust storms,fog,industrial exhalation,and so on, which influence instant irradiance in a locality on the Earth's surface and represents a source of uncertainty."}
{"text": "To obtain a comprehensive view of the meteorological conditions at a site,the recording of additional meteorological parameters such as ambient temperature,relative humidity,wind speed,and wind direction are also important."}
{"text": "Irradiation can be used for description of both global radiation and individual components (direct irradiation HB,diffuse irradiation Hp,and albedo irradiation HR). There are used hourly,daily,monthly,or yearly irradiation values.The most widely available information concerning the solar radiation resource represents monthly mean values of global horizontal daily irradiation,Ham(0).The yearly mean value of global irradiation(annual insolation map)in the world is shown in Fig.18.7.Details about solar irradiation in individual parts of the world can be found in Refs.[6-10]."}
{"text": "The clearness index KTdm is physically related to the radiation path through the at- mosphere,including also the composition and the cloud content of the atmosphere influence.And it can properly characterize the solar climate of a particular location (Fig.18.8)."}
{"text": "In cloudy days,the diffusion component of the irradiance predominates and irradi- ance comes from the celestial sphere.Therefore,for a fixed receiver,the optimum inclination angleβwould be lower than that computed from clear sky conditions."}
{"text": "The radiation input to the system and optimum panel tilt angle must be calculated from the data that are the mean values of data collected in several previous years and that is likely to remain in the years to come.Some uncertainty can be reduced by enlarging the number of years in past.These data are used to estimate the average values of the following years."}

{"text": "18.3 Photovoltaic cells and modules\n\nPhotovoltaic systems allow the direct conversion of solar energy into electrical energy without mechanical moving parts.The fundamental element enabling the direct con- version of light energy into an electric one is a PV cell that is a large-area semiconductor element that produces PV voltage at sunlight.The function of the solar cell can be described as follows."}
{"text": "In dynamic equilibrium,the recombination rate of carriers is equal to their genera- tion rate."}
{"text": "Electron-hole pairs are generated when photon energy hc/λ>Wg.From the view- point of solar energy conversion in number of generated carriers,this depends strongly on the material (band gap,band structure).Energy of photons with hc/λ<Wg cannot be transferred in excess carrier generation and surplus energy of photons with energy hc/λ>Wg(approximately hc/λ-Wg)is mostly transformed into heat (the so-called thermalization effect).Therefore,only a part of incident solar energy can be converted in free charge generation and,consequently,into electric power.The part of the solar spectrum converted in carrier generation in the case of crystalline silicon(c-Si)is shown\n\nin Fig.18.11."}
{"text": "The theoretical maximum efficiency of an ideal cell(Rs=0,only radiative recombi- nation)realized from one material in dependence on band gap with respect to solar spectrum AM 1.5 [4-7]is shown in Fig.18.12.From that,it is possible to evaluate suitability of different semiconductor materials for solar cell fabrication."}
{"text": "Carriers generated outside the PN junction diffuse to the area with a strong electric field.If they recombine before they reach the PN junction range,they will not participate in generation the PV voltage.Therefore,it is necessary to choose the technology so that recombination losses are minimal.In addition,losses associated with reflection of incident radiation from the surface must be avoided.That is why the texture is created on the surface and the surface is covered with an antireflective layer,which prevents the reflection of the light (the cells are therefore mostly dark blue)and decreases surface recombination."}
{"text": "The highest possible value of the current that the solar cell can supply at a given irradiance is the so-called short circuit current Isc.Another characteristic point is the open circuit voltage Voc,which indicates the maximum voltage on the cell that can be achieved when no appliance is connected to the cell.From the relation (18.19),the strong influence of the parasitic resistances on the I-V characteristic of the PV cell is evident.The serial resistance Rs reduces the output current and hence the efficiency of the cell.A decrease of the parallel resistance Rp reduces the open circuit voltage Voc and thus also the efficiency of the cell."}
{"text": "In the case of real cells,the I-V characteristics are influenced by the series resistance Rs.With increasing irradiance,the efficiency at the beginning increases,but with increasing voltage drop across the series resistance Rs,the current Ia increases exponentially,so at high irradiance level the efficiency can decrease with increasing irradiance [6,7]."}
{"text": "With an incident irradiance of 1kWm-²(spectrum AM1.5),the current density Jpv reaches values of 10-40 mA cm-²depending on the material used and the construction of the cell.The current Ipv is directly proportional to the area of the cell such that,for example,a standard silicon cell 15.6×15.6 cm²can generate a current of about 8A.The example of the PV cell characteristic for different irradiance levels is illustrated in Fig.18.14A,corresponding power generation shown is in Fig.18.14B."}
{"text": "The output of the solar cell is determined as the product of current and voltage.The position of the operating point on the I-V characteristic depends on the load resistance (as indicated in Fig.18.15).For each cell,there is an operating point on the characteristic in which the performance is greatest.This point is referred to as the maximum power point(MPP)of the Vmp voltage and the Imp current."}
{"text": "All parameters of PV cells are given under the standard test conditions (STC),i.e.,at irradiance(with AM1.5)of 1000Wm-²and temperature 25℃.The nominal power value of the PV cell indicates the maximum power at STC and is given inWp(the so-called watt peak,index p indicates that it is the maximum achievable power at STC).In real ap- plications,operating conditions may differ considerably from STC conditions,and the cell parameters may also vary from the nominal values."}
{"text": "The construction of PV cells depends on the properties of the starting material.If the material has a so-called direct band structure(e.g.,CdTe),the absorption coefficient for photons with hv≥Wgincreases very rapidly with their energy,so the solar radiation is fully absorbed in the layer of a few μm thick.Such cells can be realized using thin-film technologies.When the band structure is indirect (e.g.,silicon),the absorption coeffi- cient increases with the photon energy slowly,and for long-wave absorption part of the solar spectrum,a material of thickness of the order of hundred μm is needed.The dif- ference in the construction of cells with different types of band structure is schematically illustrated in Fig.18.17."}
{"text": "To obtain a high efficiency in solar cells,the construction and fabricated technology should be also prepared in the way to minimize all kind of losses in the structure."}
{"text": "Losses on the PV cell arise partly by the fact that part of the incident radiation is reflected,and a part of the surface is shaded by a cathode contact grid and a part of the incident radiation is not absorbed (optical losses).A part of generated carriers is recombined before reaching the junction area (recombination losses).Further losses are then by the serial resistance R,consisting from resistance of individual layers of the structure and the resistance of the bus during the passage of the current (electrical losses).To maximize the efficiency of the cell,cell construction is optimized to minimize total losses(material purity,thickness and resistivity of individual layers,bus contact geometry,metallization method,etc.),requiring minimal technology cost."}
{"text": "If a cell in the cell string is partially or completely shaded,the module performance drops significantly,and the shaded cell could be reversely biased and heavily loaded this way.The cells or parts of the string are thus bridged with by-pass diodes."}
{"text": "In real operation,PV cells must be protected against adverse environmental in- fluences.Because of weather conditions,module parameters degrade.The module service life indicates the operating time during which the module efficiency decreases by 20%(i.e.to 80%of the original value)."}
{"text": "18.3.3.1 Crystalline silicon (wafer-based)technology\n\nCrystalline silicon cell fabrication: Crystalline silicon PV cells are fabricated from the so-called\"semiconductor silicon\"that is prepared from metallurgical silicon by decom- position of SiHCl₃or SiH₄in purity higher than 99.9999%.From this material,either single crystal bowls are prepared by Czochralski method or multicrystalline blocks by casting technique.Mostly,the boron-doped P-type Siis used,which has lower resistivity variations along the entire length of the boule that increases the yield of c-Si material with defined parameters.Wafers of thickness in the range of 150-200μm are prepared from square-shaped rods (monocrystalline or multicrystalline)by wire cutting.In the manufacture of (standard)solar cells,six or more steps are required:texturing of the surface,phosphorous diffusion,removal of the oxide,antireflecting coating with SiNx, print screen metallization,and firing.At the end of the process,the cell parameters are measured (under standard testing conditions),and cells are sorted by Imp.Standard cell back surface field (BSF)structure is shown in Fig.18.19A ."}
{"text": "Next improvements in cell efficiency (up to 25%)are obtained from using N-type starting monocrystalline material of very low recombination rate combined with opti- mizing surface recombination and all-rear contact technology (IBC-interdigitated back contact).The structure of this type of PV cells is shown in Fig.18.19C."}

{"text": "Module fabrication: In a module,a number(usually 60 or 72)of cells are connected in series.All cells in the module should have only very small differences in Imp.In standard technology,tinned copper ribbons (tabs)are soldered to the cell bus bars at the front to connect the back surface of the next cell,to create a string,as indicated in Fig.18.21A."}
{"text": "A2-3 mm thick highly transparent soda lime glass (low iron content)is used as a substrate that provides mechanical rigidity and protection to the module.On the glass is put a sheet of the transparent encapsulate material(mostly EVA),on which strings of in-series connected cells are put.The strings are interconnected with auxiliary tabs to form the cell matrix usually consisting of several in-series connected single strings,as shown in Fig.18.21A.Terminals of the strings are brought outside the module to permit connection into the junction box.The second layer of encapsulate and the outer layer (usually a composite plastic sheet or another glass)are put on the cell matrix.The next fabrication steps are lamination and curing.The standard module structure is demon- strated in Fig.18.21B.The junction box is pasted on the rear of the module.In the box, terminals of cell strings and bypass diodes (indicated in Fig.18.21A)are connected so as to eliminate hot spots that might occur through local shading or cell damage.Crystalline silicon module parameter measuring and type approval are specified in international standard IEC61215."}
{"text": "Because of light reflection on the front side of the module,the module efficiency is a little lower than the efficiency of cells.Decreasing the reflection losses is one way in which the technology is improving."}
{"text": "Continuous technological development brings a significant decrease in the cost of components of c-Si module fabrication,as can be seen in the comparison between 2009 and 2017 costs shown in Fig.18.22.Present c-Si modules have nominal power up to 400 Wp,average efficiency of 17%(maximum 22%),and energy payback time below 2 years."}
{"text": "Basic technologies that can be used for thin-film fabrication are vacuum deposition and CVD (chemical vapor deposition).In some cases,wet processes can also be used."}
{"text": "Amorphous silicon thin-film cells: Amorphous Si is deposited from hydride gases such as SiH₄using plasma to decompose the gas(PECVD).This technology allows for large areas to be coated rather uniformly and with excellent control.A large number of the defects resulting from the incomplete bonding of the Si atoms are passivated by H atoms. The material designated as a-Si:H has 1%-10%hydrogen bonded to the Si.Films are typically deposited between 150 and 300C on substrates such as glass covered with TCO. The low deposition temperature allows low-cost substrates such as plastic to be used."}
{"text": "The structure of a-Si cells is shown in Fig.18.23A.The PIN structure is formed by doping the thin layers as they grow with doping gases containing the boron or phos- phorous atoms."}
{"text": "All practical a-Si modules contain multiple junctions.The first cell is made from amorphous silicon,and the material used for the second cell is micro-c-Si or a-SiGe Multiple junction cells may be realized in situ by changing the composition of the re- action gas.The efficiency of multiple junction thin-film cells in mass production is about 10%.An advantage of amorphous silicon thin-film cells is that their efficiency is nearly temperature independent."}
{"text": "CdTe thin-film cells:The commonly used structure based on heterojunction between CdS and CdTe is shown in Fig.18.23B.The heterojunction is formed by first depositing an N-type layer of CdS on a transparent conductive oxide on glass substrate followed by the CdTe layer and appropriate chemical annealing.From about 10 possible deposition methods,close-spaced sublimation is most commonly used.The deposition takes place in vacuum systems at temperatures of about 600℃ with CdTe deposition rates of μm/ min.The CdTe films are slightly P-type,typically 2-8μm thick,and have crystallites or grains on the order of 1μm.After CdTe layer deposition,a postdeposition anneal in the presence of Cl and O₂at around 400℃ is necessary to enlarge the grains and passivate the grain boundaries.A low-resistance contact is realized by a Cu-containing material after a surface treatment.An advantage of CdTe PV cells is a lower temperature dependence of efficiency in comparison with c-Si cells and the relatively low cost of the process technology.Present average efficiency of CdTe modules is about 13%-16%;the highest lab efficiency for CdTe solar cells is 21%."}
{"text": "CIS (CIGS)cells: The commonly used cell structure is shown in Fig.18.24.A quality ohmic contact on CulnSe2(CuInGaSe₂)can be obtained practically only with molybdenum.Therefore,Mo is sputtered on a substrate (usually soda lime glass). Following Mo deposition,the P-type CIGS absorber layer is grown by one of several unique methods."}
{"text": "After Cu(InGa)Se₂deposition,the junction is formed by chemical bath-deposited N-type CdS layer with thickness ≤50 nm.The CdS layer is overlaid with a thin,intrinsic ZnO layer,which is capped by a thicker Al-doped ZnO layer of relatively high conductivity."}
{"text": "CIGS modules seem to be very promising.Laboratory samples of efficiency 22.9% have already been prepared,and modules of efficiency 13%-16%have already been fabricated."}
{"text": "Thin-film module technology:It is possible to use the structuring of individual layers by laser cutting or mechanical scribing to prepare a module consisting from several in- series connected solar cells on a single glass substrate,as shown in Fig.18.25A."}

{"text": "The module price development in dependence on cumulative installed power is shown in Fig.18.26."}
{"text": "Fifteen years ago,thin-film technologies were expected to be very promising and capable to replace c-Si technology.The market share for thin-film modules increased until 2009,when it reached almost 20%.After steep drop in the price of c-Si modules between 2008 and the end of 2012,the market share of thin-film modules has declined steadily since then to about 5%in 2017,while over 95%of module production were c-Si PV modules [13-16],as demonstrated in Fig.18.27."}
{"text": "Even though many papers have been published dealing with particular technologies, the main target,to prepare modules with an efficiency and durability similar to that of conventional silicon-based cells but with much cheaper production costs,has not yet been reached.However,some of the structures may come to the commercial phase in a few years."}
{"text": "18.3.3.4 The module parameters degradation and the service life\n\nThe performance of a PV module decreases over time.Degradation has different causes, which may include effects of humidity,temperature,solar irradiation,and DC voltage bias effects;this is referred to as potential-induced degradation.Other factors affecting the degradation rate include the quality of materials used in manufacture,the manu- facturing process,and the quality of assembly and packaging of the cells into the module.Some failures at the PV array assembling can also induce or accelerate degra- dation processes."}
{"text": "More details about defects and degradation in PV modules can be found in Ref. [17] . PV modules may have a long-term power output degradation rate of between 0.3% and 1.0%per annum.For crystalline modules,a generic degradation rate of 0.4%per annum is often considered applicable.Some module manufacturers have carried out specific independent tests,showing that lower degradation rates can be safely assumed."}
{"text": "For a-Si and CIGS modules,a generic degradation rate of 0.7-1.0%is often consid- ered reasonable,however a degradation rate of more than 1.5%has sometimes been observed.For CdTe,a value of 0.4%-0.6%is often applicable."}
{"text": "Power degradation over time is warranted by the manufacturers as a service life,that is,time period between starting operation and decreasing output power below 80%of the nominate value.In general,good quality PV modules can be at present expected to have a service life of 25-30 years.The risk of increased rates of degradation becomes higher thereafter."}
{"text": "18.4 Photovoltaic systems\n\nPV modules represent a source of DC voltage and current.Present PV modules have rated power up to 400 Wp.For applications,PV modules are usually connected in series into strings to increase output voltage,and strings of PV modules can be connected in parallel to build current and voltage output.This way PV array is constructed from building blocks of modules to panels(according to Ref.[12],the panel means several PV modules mechanically integrated,preassembled,and electrically interconnected)and subarrays that form a mechanically and electrically integrated DCpower generation unit."}
{"text": "To operate in MPP,itis necessary to transform the impedance of one circuit (source)to the other circuit (load)using DC-DC converters.The duty ratio changing of the DC-DC converter results in an impedance change as seen by the PV array.At a particular impedance (or duty ratio),the operating point will be at the peak power transfer point. Maximum power point tracking(MPPT)is the process of finding this point and keeping the load characteristic there.MPPT utilize different types of control circuit or logic to search for this point and thus to allow the converter circuit to extract the maximum power available from a PV source.MPPT implementations utilize algorithms that frequently sample PV source voltages and currents and then adjust the duty ratio as needed. Microcontrollers are employed to implement the algorithms.The most often used algo- rithms are\"perturb and observe\",incremental conductance,parasitic capacitance,and constant voltage(CV).Details about these MPPT algorithms can be found in Ref. [18]."}

{"text": "-Supply surge currents:To provide surge currents to loads like motors when required\n\nStand-alone autonomous PV systems consist of a field of PV modules and an energy accumulator (most commonly used with electrochemical accumulators)and are inde- pendent of the grid.PV array maximum power voltage at the highest temperature should be higher than the accumulator battery voltage."}
{"text": "Improved efficiency can be achieved by using the DC-DC converter schematically depicted in Fig.18.29B,which allows controlling the output voltage of the PV array to match the MPPT."}
{"text": "The disadvantage of these systems is usually the lower voltage(12V or 24V)given by the type of accumulator used,requiring special types of appliances,and a large cross- section of the wires.Another option to use common network appliances is to add the system to the inverter as shown in Fig.18.29B."}
{"text": "Autonomous PV systems are used in a very wide range of applications,where an independent power supply is needed or at locations too distant from the power supply. Applications include battery recharging,parking automation,traffic signaling,power supply in places without electrical connections (farms,cottages,gardens,motor homes, and yachts),water pumping,navigation lights,retransmission stations,telecommuni- cation,etc.The performance of individual systems is moving from tens of Wp(mea- surement and signaling)up to MWp.In remote areas,autonomous PV systems are very important for the spread of modern information technology.Many examples of auton- omous PV systems are described in Refs.[19,20]."}
{"text": "Because the conditions for operating autonomous PV systems in the winter months are relatively unfavorable (less energy received during 1 day,higher consumption),in some cases,it is advisable to implement hybrid PV systems that are expanded by another additional power source (wind generator,power plant,or small hydropower plant)[7,20]."}
{"text": "Grid inverters can be single-phase or three-phase(depending on the type of inverter)."}
{"text": "The inverters must perform all necessary safety and security functions (voltage,fre- quency,network impedance,power failure,safe disconnection,or galvanic isolation) and meet the quality standards of the power supply,i.e.,all requirements of the local grid codes have to be met during the operation.Therefore,inverters operating in pulse width modulation mode,synchronized by the grid,are used.All these functions must be delivered in a very reliable way over many years of operation,with as little maintenance as possible;often,they have to be fulfilled under very harsh environmental conditions. Details about grid converters for PVs can be found in Ref.[21]."}

{"text": "With respect to the size of the PV field,some of the basic arrangements of the PV power plant shown in Fig.18.31 can be selected."}
{"text": "The modular inverter is a low-power inverter(up to 300W)that is installed directly on the solar module of the system.All modules therefore have their inverters whose outputs are connected in parallel and are connected to the network.The advantage is the reduction of the cost of the DC link,which has a minimum length.This system can easily be expanded with additional modules to achieve considerable performance.In addition, if one of the modules is partially overshadowed,there is no significant increase in the overall PV field losses.The disadvantage is the relatively high price of the system."}
{"text": "The central inverter converts the power of all modules (up to 2.5 MW),which are connected in series and in parallel.The advantage of this system is a higher working voltage,which is favorable for reducing line losses and better efficiency of the inverter. However,this solution cannot be extended by other connected modules without increasing the nominal power of the inverter,which in practice means replacing it with a more powerful type.Fault localization is relatively complicated."}
{"text": "The string inverter is used for combinations of previous wiring,where several mod- ules are connected in series and the power of this string(up to 15 kW)is processed by one inverter.These strings can be several in the system and can be expanded more easily than one central inverter.Localization of any malfunction is considerably easier than in the case of a central inverter.Frequently,it is used where three different strings deliver power to three phases of the mains."}
{"text": "Inverters are often included in the BOS."}
{"text": "Photovoltaic modules are mounted on supporting structures that are either fixed (static)or movable.Fixed structures can also be built on roofs or building facades.From the point of view of the optimal use of solar energy,an optimum orientation PVarray can be found using some of the database [8-10].When installing the panels,care should be taken to avoid partial shading of the PV modules.Possible overshoot of one or more of the modules can result in a significant increase in losses(the shaded module does not produce energy and becomes an appliance)and thus reduces the efficiency of the system."}
{"text": "The reference yield YR is defined as the ratio of total in-plane solar irradiation H (index t refers to the time interval,mostly a year)measured by pyranometer to the reference irradiance GsTc(1000 Wm-²).Yr=Hr(GsTc)-¹,that gives irradiation equiva- lent hours at STC in monitored interval.The second is the so-called final yield YF (production equivalent hours)as the ratio of the AC energy produced by the system to the system nominal power.The PV system performance ratio PR=YF/YR(YF and YR are integrated over the same time period)represents the fraction of energy actually available after deducting energy loses."}
{"text": "Even PV systems are designed and installed with the intention that they be fully functional for a minimum of 20-30 years,and monitoring and control of systems is essential for reliable functioning and maximum yield.Values such as PV array power,AC grid power,and PV array current are usually available,environmental data—such as module temperature,ambient temperature,solar radiation,and wind speed—can also be data logged,stored,and analyzed."}
{"text": "The maintenance requirements vary depending on the system size,installation type, and locations.Stand-alone systems require more maintenance consideration due to the addition of batteries.Guidelines for PV system monitoring and maintenance can be found in Refs.[23,24]."}
{"text": "As the cost of BOS increases with the PV system area,it gives further advantage to PV modules of higher efficiency.However,cost of some parts,such as inverter,switch- boards,protections,etc.,does not depend on the system area and limits the BOS cost reduction by using modules of higher efficiency."}
{"text": "The investment cost IC consists of the module cost and BOS cost.Increasing the module efficiency,the module cost usually increases (an increase in technology cost), while BOS cost deceases.EP₁increases with the module efficiency.An optimum solution-minimizing ratio ICEP₁can be found [27]."}
{"text": "In the past,the investment cost of PV systems was very high,and an essential part of the total cost was the module cost.Increasing volume of production decreases cost of both PV modules and BOS,and this leads to decrease of LCOE on a level comparable with other energy sources.As published in Ref.[28],the lowest average LCOE from power stations coming into operation in 2022 should be natural gas(combined cycle)\n\n50 USD/MWh,wind (onshore)59.1 USD(MWh)-¹,PV system 63.2 USD(MWh)-¹, advanced nuclear 92.6 USD (MWh)-¹,and biomass 95.3 USD (MWh)-¹.From that fol- lows that on-grid PV systems will be an important part of future energy mix."}

{"text": "19.2.1 Parabolic trough power plants\n\nParabolic trough power plants consist of large fields of parabolic trough collectors.The solar field is modular in nature and comprises many parallel rows of single-axis tracking parabolic trough solar collectors,usually aligned on a north-south horizontal axis.Each solar collector has a linear parabolic-shaped reflector that focuses the sun's direct beam radiation onto a linear receiver(absorber tube)located at the focus of the parabola.The collectors track the sun from east to west during the day to ensure that the sun is continuously focused on the receiver.Thermal oil,a heat transfer fluid (HTF),is heated up to 393℃ as it circulates through the receiver and returns to a steam generator to produce slightly superheated steam at a pressure of 50-100 bar,that is then fed into a steam turbine as part of a conventional steam cycle power plant."}
{"text": "Most of the commercial parabolic trough power plants today(see Fig.19.4)are using a diphenyl-oxide/biphenyl eutectic mixture as heat transfer fluid (HTF).The maximum cycle temperature is limited to values below 400C in order to avoid decomposition of the HTF [17].However advanced silicon oil based mixtures currently under testing may allow temperatures up to 450℃ [18].A single reheat Rankine cycle with 100-105 bar and 377-383℃ live steam conditions is typically used.They are equipped with six preheating stages:three low pressure preheaters,the deaerator and two high pressure preheaters."}
{"text": "Annual efficiency of parabolic trough power plants is currently about 15%(electricity generated over incident energy)[20].Larger power blocks would increase this efficiency (16%annual efficiency for a 110 MW dry cooled plant [20]with 39.5%design cycle ef- ficiency is reported)."}
{"text": "Plants with thermal storage (Fig.19.5)are typically using 2-tank molten salt systems with a near eutectic mixture of sodium nitrate (60%)and potassium nitrate(40%)as storage medium.Hot HTF from the solar field is used to charge the storage during time periods when the solar field delivers excess heat.Storage discharging is done via HTF too using the same heat exchangers as for charging but with reverse flow of HTF and salt. This arrangement leads to live and reheat steam temperatures during storage discharge operation which are about 10K lower compared to direct utilization of the solar heat. The cycle efficiency in storage discharge mode is slightly lower since the lower HTF temperature causes lower live steam temperature in storage discharge mode."}
{"text": "Integrated solar combined cycle plants (ISCCS)are combined cycle power plants using additional solar heat generated by parabolic troughs in the bottom cycle.Three ISCCS plants are in operation:Kuraymat(Egypt),Hassi R'Mel (Algeria)and Ain Beni Mathar (Morocco).Two further plants:Archimede (Italy)and Martin Next Generation Solar (Florida)can also be counted under this category.But due to the low solar con- tributions to such fossil fired power plants the concept is not followed further.In 2018 about 80%of all commercial CSP systems use parabolic trough technology."}
{"text": "19.2.1.1 Direct steam generation\n\nThe limitation of the upper process temperature to about 400℃ can be overcome by a change of the heat transfer fluid.An obvious alternative is water/steam which is used in the steam cycle anyway.The technology is known as Direct Solar Steam Generation (DSG)and was successfully demonstrated in the European research project DISS [22].In a DSG collector field,water is pre-heated,evaporated,and superheated.Steam param- eters reached in demonstration loops are 110 bar and 500℃[23]Aside from the process temperature,the benefits of DSG compared to oil are based on savings in the heat exchanger,in reduced pumping effort,and the uncritical handing of the medium.Due to the two-phase flow conditions in the evaporator section the layout of the solar field differs from the traditional oil field.The solar field consists of a pre-heating and evap- oration sub-field being operated in a forced recirculation mode by means of a steam drum.From the steam drum,saturated steam enters the superheating sub-field and finally a collecting header which transports the steam to the turbine.Research projects have demonstrated the operation of a collector loop in once-through mode without a steam drum [24].Thermal storage systems for DSG plants are composed of a phase change material storage part and a sensible storage part [25].These systems have proven their functionality but have to undergo further cost reductions to be competitive.In addition to the linear Fresnel plants with DSG in operation today,one commercial 5MW plant with parabolic trough collector technology was connected to the electricity grid of Thailand in 2012 [26].Apart from the electricity production,DSG systems are very interesting for high temperature process heat applications like enhanced oil recovery."}
{"text": "Current main candidates are nitrate salts.Sodium (60 w%)and potassium(40 w%) nitrate is being used in the 5MW-Archimede plant [31].The upper allowed temperature is above 550℃ [32];first crystallization of the non-eutectic melt occurs at 238℃.Adding further substances to the salt allows lower crystallization and freezing temperatures. Very promising future nitrate salts are calcium/sodium/potassium nitrate and lithium/ sodium/potassium nitrate;the eutectic mixtures achieve solidification temperatures of 133 and 120℃,still at high maximal temperatures of>480 and 550°℃,respectively [33]. The overall band of currently investigated salt candidates varies broadly [34,35]."}
{"text": "Nevertheless,there are also concerns about molten-salt-based parabolic trough plants.Due to the high solidification temperature the process setup needs to be adapted [36],thus,the solar plant is fully equipped with impedance and trace heating systems in order to secure non-freezing of the salt.Salt melting at high temperatures are regarded as highly corrosive,but the latest research and process experience with demonstration plants show that this can be handled with the right choice of stainless steel [37].Both main issues and their handling lead to higher investment costs.In current research projects [31,38]it shall be demonstrated that the increase in total plant efficiency and lower storage and HTF costs will overcome the higher investment in solar field and piping and therefore lead to a decrease in electricity costs of solar thermal power plants."}
{"text": "Linear Fresnel collector systems are traditionally used for direct steam generation in the collector field.Realized plants are operated with saturated steam at about 55 bar (Novatec Solar PE-2 with 30 MW [39],Liddell steam augmentation system with 9.3 MWth [40]).In 2018 only 3%of all commercial CSP systems were based on Linear Fresnel Technology."}
{"text": "19.2.3 Central receiver systems\n\nCentral receiver systems (also called solar tower or power tower)consist of a large number of two-axis tracking mirrors(heliostats)each with a surface of 20-200 m²and a heat exchanger (receiver)located at the top of a central tower (see Fig.19.7).The maximum distance from the farthest heliostats to the receiver easily exceeds 1 kilometre in power plants of some 10 MWel of capacity.The receiver,in most cases a tube bundle heat exchanger,may also be positioned inside a cavity to reduce heat losses.The poor heat transfer characteristics of air make it difficult to be used in tube bundles.Therefore, porous structures are also used as absorbers in this case.The concentrated solar radi- ation is absorbed inside the volume of the material and transferred to air that is sucked in through the structure.This\"volumetric\"receiver concept allows an excellent heat transfer and very high concentration factors."}
{"text": "Central receiver systems are considered to have a large potential for mid-term cost reduction of electricity compared to parabolic trough technology,because they can achieve higher temperatures,resulting in more efficient steam cycles or ultimately higher exergy cycles using gas turbines at temperatures above 1000℃ to further increase efficiency and throughput."}
{"text": "However,solar tower technology had a slower technology start compared to parabolic trough so that by 2018 less than 20%of all commercial CSP plants are based on tower technology.Nevertheless,a variety of solar tower concepts has been demonstrated so far. These concepts differ mainly in the type of heat transfer medium which is dominating the layout and selection of all other components except of the heliostat field."}
{"text": "Liquid or gaseous heat transfer fluids are state of the art in solar tower technology."}
{"text": "An alternative option has been followed in the solar tower Jülich [43],a pre- commercial solar tower demonstration plant in Germany with a power level of 1.5MWel.Air at near-ambient pressure is used as heat transfer medium.The air is heated with solar energy in an open volumetric receiver to about 700℃.The hot air can be used directly in a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG)to produce power in the steam cycle. Alternatively,in charge mode hot air is directed to the regenerator type storage system. In discharge mode the flow direction in the regenerator is reversed to heat the entering air which is then used in the HRSG for power generation.The heliostat field contains over 2000 heliostats with a total mirror area of about 18,000 m² ."}

{"text": "Solar dish-engine systems are being developed for use in emerging global markets for distributed generation,green power,remote power and grid-connected applications. Individual units,ranging in size from 9 to 25kW,can operate independent of power grids in remote sunny locations pumping water or providing electricity for locals.However, cost reduction in PV that can be used in similar application has put dish systems into a difficult competitive situation.Since the integration of storage is rather challenging into the small dish systems they typically cannot benefit from any kind of security-of-supply bonus.Thus,in today's CSP markets Dish-Stirling systems have gained less than 1% market share in terms of installed power."}

{"text": "19.3.2 Potential impact of CSP until 2050\n\nThe evidence of global warming due to carbon dioxide emissions,the risk related with nuclear energy,but also the limited availability of resources require the transformation of the energy supply to a sustainable energy system.As the radiation potential of solar energy worldwide is almost infinite solar energy may be one of the strongest contributors in the solution of this problem.Only 1%of the Sahara desert used for CSP systems would be sufficient to satisfy today's world electricity demand.The impact of CSP in Sunbelt countries appears to become very important after 2030 due to the low cost electricity and dispatchability of the technology.But even for non-Sunbelt regions CSP offers the option to provide an important contribution to achieve challenging CO₂reductions at mini- mum energy prices,if HVDC grid infrastructure becomes available in time."}
{"text": "potential but the deployment of a wide mixture of renewable energy technologies is critical,too.However,while PV and wind technologies are on track,the progress in other technologies like Bioenergy,Ocean Energy,Geothermal and CSP is currently too slow to reach this goal."}
{"text": "19.3.3 Further options\n\nConcentrating solar technologies in particular point focusing systems offer the benefit of producing high temperature process heat that could also be used in reactors to run endothermic chemical reactions [48].This way,chemical commodities or even more important solar fuels may be produced.This widens not only the field of application of concentrating solar technologies,but also creates additional market opportunities of- fering other products than electricity."}
{"text": "CSP and PV power plants can be used in solar-rich locations in connection with the high-temperature electrolysis very efficiently to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and produce hydrogen fuel in perspective,as the plants can be operated in base load and achieve very high conversion efficiencies through the broad set of additional high- temperature heat."}
{"text": "A promising alternative example is the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen through high temperature thermochemical cycles.In contrast to the alternative option of using solar electricity in combination with an electrolyser,the high temperature ther- mochemical approach requires fewer conversion steps,thus offering higher efficiencies and less equipment."}

{"text": "Geothermal systems are typically divided into liquid-dominated and vapor- dominated systems.Liquid-dominated systems contain fluid at moderate-to-high tem- perature and are hosted in geological environments characterized by active tectonism.

{"text": "The structure,and chemistry,of a typical geothermal system is shown in Fig.20.2."}
{"text": "Part of the appraisal of a geothermal resource includes evaluating the amount of \"stored heat\"it contains.That calculation is a volumetric one that sums the total amount of thermal energy stored in both reservoir rock and fluids (see Ref. [4]).Note that the reservoir rock typically contains significantly more energy than the fluids hosted in the rock.Only a fraction of the energy in a geothermal resource can be recovered by flowing fluids to production wells.The ratio of energy recovery to energy stored in the resources is known as the recovery factor.Recovery factors observed in producing systems vary from 5%to 25%[5].In a geothermal system,which is being used for electricity gener- ation,the energy content is normally expressed in units of MW(electrical)as opposed to MW(thermal).This involves applying a conversion efficiency (average 12%,but dependent on plant type [6])from thermal to electrical energy and accounting for parasitic loads in the electricity generation process."}

{"text": "One of the most commonly used exploration techniques for geothermal reservoirs is magnetotelluric surveying(MT).This infers electrical conductivity in the Earth by detecting variations in magnetic and electric fields.The methods allow zones of low resistivity(such as clay caps)to be detected.A geothermal reservoir will typically have lower resistivity due to the combination of high temperature,fluid salinity,and altered rock properties.The method is also usual for detecting structural features such as faults(Fig.20.3)."}
{"text": "20.3 Drilling and testing\n\nOnce an exploration target has been defined through exploration (involving geological, geophysical,and geochemical considerations),exploration wells are drilled to further prove(or disprove)the geological concept model that has been developed of the system. The drilling process is similar,in principle,to drilling for oil and gas using a rotary rig. Drilling is a major source of cost in any geothermal development.Capuano [10]cites costs of $US 4.5 to 5.5 million per installed megawatt.Drilling and well completion (of both production and reinjection wells)may amount to 50%of the cost of a development."}
{"text": "While the drilling rigs used in geothermal drilling are broadly similar to those used in oil and gas,geothermal drilling occurs in a much higher temperature environment than typical oil and gas drilling,which means tools,equipment,and materials have to be carefully selected to withstand the temperatures involved.In a geothermal setting, drilling mud must be cooled to maintain its properties.The high temperatures involved are a harsh environment for electronics associated with well drilling and logging.Cement formulated for a high temperature environment must be used to cement well casing.The rock formations involved are typically harder (e.g.,granites and basalts).Well control processes must consider managing both temperature and pressure in geothermal well. Deviated drilling technology is common in the geothermal industry.This allows well trajectories to deviate from being purely vertical.The well path is then able to be opti- mized in relation to natural fractures and faults present in the rock."}

{"text": "After a well is drilled,measurements will be taken from the well to assess reservoir pressure and temperature.It is also important to understand the permeability of the reservoir rock surrounding the well,as this is one of the key controls of the flow rate of fluid from the well.Natural fluid in a geothermal reservoir will be convective,i.e.,fluid heated by a high-temperature source will rise through buoyancy.This upwardly rising fluid may create \"surface features\"such as hot springs,geysers,or steaming ground."}
{"text": "When testing a well,zones where convective flow is occurring will appear as \"isothermal sections\"in a plot of temperature versus depth,i.e.,the temperature re- ported by the logging tool does not vary with depth according to a typical geothermal gradient.This can occur because the well encounters permeable \"feed zones,\"which allow for fluid inflow to the well or outflow from the well.Fluid then flows in the system via the well,which must be factored into interpretation of any measurements from the well."}
{"text": "Feed zone depths can be assessed by conducting an injection test in which fluid at surface temperature is injected.A temperature log is run during injection,and feed zone depths can be identified from changes in the behavior of the temperature profile with depth.After injection ceases,the well enters a \"heat up\"phase.Temperature logging continues and normally shows that in feed zones,the well temperature heats up more slowly than in less permeable zones."}
{"text": "Pressure transient testing is done in geothermal wells and is analyzed in a similar manner to transient tests done in oil and gas wells.A pressure transient test can be used to infer reservoir permeability from analysis of the rate of pressure change after a change in well flow rate(e.g.,after the end of an injection test).Geothermal reservoirs typically consist of rocks that contain networks of natural fractures-which is a factor that must be considered during the interpretation of the pressure transient test response.For a detailed discussion of pressure transient testing theory and analysis in geothermal reservoir,engineering readers are referred to Ref.[12]."}
{"text": "Once testing is complete,reservoir engineers will be able to develop an initial assessment of the ability for a well to produce(or inject)geothermal fluid.Test drilling, after geoscientific exploration,is part of the high“up-front cost”required in a geothermal project required to derisk a project.The evolution of the risk and cost in a typical geothermal project is shown in Fig.20.4."}

{"text": "One key chemistry consideration in the design and operation of any plant is the precipitation of silica.As geothermal fluids go through a flash stage,the concentration of silica in the brine increases,and the temperature of the fluid decreases.If the fluid is supersaturated with silica,then the silica can precipitate as a solid scale in pipe- lines etc.,at the surface or within wellbores.Large amounts of silica scaling are un- desirable and can adversely affect the production process.Managing the temperature of the fluid at all stages is therefore important to avoid unnecessary amounts of silica precipitation."}

{"text": "Maintaining reservoir pressure and temperature is important in sustainable pro- duction of geothermal systems.Reinjection of produced fluid is an important reservoir management strategy.Rivera Diaz et al.[16]provides an excellent review of worldwide experience with reinjection and outlines the reasoning for reinjection depending on the nature of the reservoir.In vapor-dominated systems,it is useful to reinject water above the depleted reservoir zone,as these systems may run out of water while there is still heat remaining in the rock.In liquid-dominated systems,the pressure drop as fluid is produced is not normally excessive(as the reservoirs boil).However,these systems may slowly cool as extracted water and steam are replaced (recharged)by cooler fluids flowing laterally.In other systems,which are not at a temperature high enough to boil,then reservoir pressures will decline as fluids are produced.This will ultimately reduce the productivity well.In these cases,reinjection will support reservoir pressure;however,the location of the injection wells needs to balance the need for pressure support with the risk of injected cool fluid making its way to pro- duction wells."}
{"text": "Monitoring microseismic events is also a useful way to understand reservoir struc- tures.McNamara et al.[17]discuss microseismic monitoring in the Rotokawa field in New Zealand.They observe that microseismic events are generally close to injection wells and that the microseismic events are generally due to thermal contraction asso- ciated with thermal contraction of rock when cooler injected fluids are injected into a hot reservoir.Mapping event locations in the field demonstrated that fluid flow is impeded across the Central Field Fault."}

{"text": "20.7 Geothermal energy and the environment\n\nGeothermal power generation does have some associated greenhouse gas emissions- which depend on the type of plant (i.e.,flash vs.binary)and the geothermal fluid.These emissions are predominantly CO₂;however,methane can also be present in geothermal fluid.Fridriksson et al.[21]describes the geological and geochemical mechanisms that give rise to the presence of CO₂in geothermal fluid.Fridriksson et al.[21]also give data on CO₂emission factors showing that,in general,geothermal power generation com- pares very favorably in terms of CO₂emissions to fossil fuel-based generation with a global average CO₂emission factor for geothermal of 122g/kWh.The emission does however vary by location with Iceland's geothermal power production having low emissions at an average 34 g/kWh and Italian plants operating at an average emission factor of 330 g/kWh.Turkey has a geothermal fluid with a high CO₂content-which can result in CO₂emission factors in Turkish projects,which are higher than would be observed with fossil fuel-based generation."}
{"text": "Geothermal fluids also contain hydrogen sulphide (H₂S).Emissions of H₂S are nor- mally carefully regulated and monitored.Research with numerical simulations has shown that there are potential benefits to reinjecting these gases into reservoirs-in terms of managing/maintaining research pressure.Laboratory-scale experiments [22] also show that the geochemical effects may cause a helpful enhancement of porosity and permeability near wells when these gases are injected."}
{"text": "Modern geothermal power plant designs typically reinject produced liquids into the subsurface so there is no net discharge of fluid at surface.Older plants,such as Wairakei in New Zealand,do discharge fluid at the surface (in this case to the Waikato River).The effects of this discharge on the river are outlined at https://www.waternz.org.nz/ Attachment?Action=Download&Attachment_id=523.One particularly innovative tech- nology used at the Wairakei plant to minimize the flow of H₂S to the Waikato River is a bioreactor that consists of 350 km of pipe which fluid from the power station flow through before it reaches the Waikato River.This pipe has been charged with sulfur- oxidizing bacteria,which metabolize sulfur as the plant discharge makes its way through the piping.This results in an 80%reduction in the concentration of H₂S,which reaches the Waikato River."}
{"text": "Subsidence is an environmental concern that must be carefully monitored and managed in sites where geothermal fluids are being produced.The Wairakei field in New Zealand has led to localized subsidence of up to 15m in some locations [23].Subsidence is caused by the interaction of pressure depletion in the subsurface,mechanical stress changes,and variability in rock and soil properties.Properly managing injection into the geothermal system is crucial to avoid subsidence and to ensure sustainability develop- ment of a system.The linkage between fluid pressure changes and geomechanical changes is also leading to coupled numerical models being developed and used to model these effects-both to understand past performance in geothermal systems and to pre- dict future behaviors."}
{"text": "20.8 Geothermal energy and communities\n\nGeothermal energy is a treasured nature resource for indigenous people in many com- munities.Appropriate development of geothermal resources can only be truly successful if it respects community needs and values and has operated ownership models.In New Zealand,geothermal generation companies often operate in commercial partnerships with Maori land trusts (for example,Mercury,see https://www.mercury.co.nz/about/ partnerships/iwi.aspx).The history of Maori rangatiratanga(control and authority) over geothermal resources is outlined in Ref.

{"text": "Supercritical systems also feature in future considerations of geothermal energy production.In a supercritical reservoir,the fluid is beyond the critical point (374℃ and 22.2 MPa for pure water,though the salinity of geothermal brine will shift its critical point above this).In a supercritical state,the fluid carries much more energy.Iceland's Deep Drilling Project(see www.iddp.is)aims to explore the geothermal potential of supercritical systems and drilled into the Krafla basaltic caldera where magma at 900℃ entered the well,causing the drilling to cease.Elders and Moore [28]note that“The well was highly productive and capable of generating more than 35 MWe from superheated steam at a well-head temperature of about 450℃.”\n\nDrilling is estimated to account for approximately 40%of the total cost of a new high temperature geothermal power generation project [31].A range of technologies are being considered to increase the rate of penetration in drilling (reducing drilling time)to more readily allow drilling to occur at deeper depths and to lower drilling costs.These tech- nologies include methods such as spallation drilling,laser drilling,and plasma drilling. None of these technologies are yet commercially available."}
{"text": "The future is also likely to see increased emphasis on scope for utilization of the energy in water which is\"coproduced\"with oil from oil wells.As oil wells mature,many produce significant volumes of water(much more water than oil).Liu et al.[30]present a screening methodology to review oil and gas reservoirs for power production potential (in terms of flow rate,wellhead temperature,water cut,reservoir temperature,perme- ability,porosity,etc.).Liu et al.present a case study implying a single well in the Villafortuna-Trecate oil field could produce25 GWh of electric power,with a net present value of up to one millon euro over 10 years."}

{"text": "The following sections of this chapter overviews the current state ofthe art of various thermochemical and biological conversion techniques,including fermentation,trans- esterification,fast pyrolysis,microwave-assisted pyrolysis,hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL),anaerobic digestion,combustion,and gasification,for the production of con- ventional and advanced biofuels and the generation of heat and power from various types of biomass."}
{"text": "Harun and Danquah [9]explored the effect of acid pretreatment on the bioethanol production from microalgae by using a central composite design approach.This resulted in a maximum bioethanol concentration of 7.2gL-¹,which was achieved using an acid pretreatment of 1%(v/v)H₂SO₄at 140℃ for 30 min,with a biomass concentration of 15gL-¹.However,the loss of carbohydrates and the formation of toxic intermediates still represent as major technical barrier for large-scale applications [10]."}
{"text": "A biological treatment using enzyme or fungi has been applied in the pretreatment of biomass.This does however involve long processing times,together with the high cost of enzymes and low hydrolysis rates—all of which are common problems for biological pretreatment processes.Recently,a combination of two or more pretreatment tech- niques have been developed with an aim for overcoming various weaknesses of current pretreatment approaches.For instance,Hernández et al.[11]reported that the combi- nation of acid and enzymatic pretreatment resulted in the highest concentration of monosaccharides by 128 mg g-¹and 129 mgg-¹for Chlorella sorokiniana and Nannochloropsis gaditana,respectively."}
{"text": "Notwithstanding,there remain several challenges for commercializing butanol pro- duction with regard to establishing in situ methods for butanol removal during ABE fermentation and a solvent-resistant butanol producer in the fermentation process [29]."}
{"text": "The physiochemical properties of bio-oil,such as feedstock characteristics,temper- ature,heating rate,and catalyst type and dosage,are influenced by the operational parameters.Dong et al. [48] evaluated the effect of temperature on the chemical composition of bio-oil obtained from fast pyrolysis of polar wood.The authors reported that the yield of levoglucosan (LG)(the most dominant anhydrosugars from cellulose) initially increased with increasing temperature from 350 to 550℃,which could be due to the cleavage of the glycosidic bond.However,further increase in temperature (up to 1000℃)led to a lower LG yield.This might be attributed to the competition between LG formation and fragmentation reactions and/or the promotion of secondary cracking of LG at higher temperatures.Similar trends can also be observed in the 1,4-anhydro-α-D- xylopyranose from xylan (arabinoglucuronoxylan,the major hemicellulose component of polar wood).In another study,Wang et al. [49] explored the fast pyrolysis performance of lignin derived from ginkgo (Maidenhair tree),polar,and wheat straw at various temperatures.It was observed that the amounts of monoaromatics,alkoxylated ben- zenes,and the catechol-type compounds increased with an increase in temperature, which suggests the higher temperature might stimulate dihydroxylation,alkylation,and demethylation reactions."}
{"text": "To date,a number of types of biomass feedstock have been applied for HTL to obtain bio-oil,such as pinewood [65],beech wood [66],rice straw [67],rice husk [68],wheat straw [69],food waste [70],algae [71,72],and sewage sludge [73]etc.HTLof biomass is primarily dependent on the feedstock properties and numerous operating conditions including temperature,reaction time,biomass concentration,reaction atmosphere, pressure,and catalyst type and dosage.Among them,temperature is considered to be the most important factor affecting the products distribution and biocrude properties.In normal,the role of temperature in HTL can be defined as the competition between hydrolysis and repolymerization.Initially,the depolymerization of biomass macromol- ecules occurs when the temperature is higher than the activation energies required for the bond breakage.At the final stage,the repolymerization appears to be active,and this leads to the formation of char from small oil molecules,thereby negatively affecting bio- oil yield.The maximum yield of biocrude is usually obtained at intermediate tempera- ture range (i.e.,250-375°℃) [74]."}
{"text": "avoiding the competition with crop production [77].Most previous studies have focused on the conversion of algae into biodiesel,biocrude,and biogas via transesterification [78-81],HTL[72,82,83],and anaerobic digestion [84-87],respectively.In this section,a brief description of in situ transesterification,HTL,and anaerobic digestion and their most recent case studies are presented."}
{"text": "However,it should be noted that most research studies on HTL of algae have been conducted using a small batch reactor,stirred,unstirred,or shaken.Literature regarding algal HTL in a continuous-flow reactor is still lacking.Besides,most studies have used homogenous catalysts (mostly Na₂CO₃and KOH)in the algal liquefaction.However,the use of heterogenous catalysts might be the direction for future study on algal liquefac- tion,owing to their beneficial effects on the biocrude yield and quality,particularly on the denitrogenation [95].Most importantly,the high N content in the algae-derived biocrude should be addressed;otherwise,it might cause high NOxemissions."}
{"text": "Gasification of biomass is a thermochemical conversion approach,during which the carbonaceous materials can be converted into syngas,tars,and char in a partially oxidizing condition.Syngas as the main product from biomass gasification is primarily composed of H₂,CO,CO₂,and CH₄,accompanied by some short-chain hydrocarbons. Because of the combustibility of syngas in nature,it can be directly used for heat and power generation through combustion in engines or gas turbines [102].In comparison to other thermochemical technologies,gasification treatment aims to produce large amounts of syngas,while,in contrast,torrefaction is employed to improve the energy density of lignocellulosic biomass via oxygen removal.In addition,fast pyrolysis is operated in absence of oxygen at temperatures of 300-600℃ and atmospheric pressure, resulting in bio-oil as the main product.Commonly,coal is the most common raw material for producing syngas by gasification owing to the well-established conversion process and the low cost of coal.Recently,biomass and organic wastes can also be used in the gasification process in response to global warming and depletion of nonrenewable energy.Notwithstanding,the practical implementation of biomass gasification might be challenging as few commercial gasification plants mainly applied biomass as the feed- stocks.Typically,gasification agent is regarded as the most important factor determining the syngas composition and energy content.Because of its low cost and easy for acquisition,air is often employed as the gasification agent.However,the use of air leads to a low energy density of syngas,which is attributed to the presence of impurities and N2 in the syngas and thus lowers its heating value.On the other hand,air-blown gasi- fication offers beneficial effects on the restriction of tar formation and improving syngas formation [99].Alternatively,oxygen and steam have been employed as the oxidizing agent in the biomass gasification,and a higher heating value of syngas can be achieved."}
{"text": "(4) In spite of pyrolysis-based bio-oil being renewable and environmental-friendly, there are several challenges in terms of oil quality that must be addressed before its practical applications as transportation fuels such as high water,O,and ash\n\ncontent,high viscosity and corrosiveness,low energy density,and poor ignition and combustion performance [44]."}
{"text": "(5) Most of current literature for HTL of biomass has carried out experiments in small batch autoclave;however,few studies have been conducted in continuous reactor systems.Besides,the underlying reaction pathways for liquefaction of biomass\n\nlike algae are still unclear [95]."}
{"text": "(6) Although algae are promising sources for producing biofuels and value-added products,the cost-effective and more scalable upstream and downstream pro- cesses for cultivation,pretreatment,and harvesting are still lacking [42] ."}

{"text": "To actually achieve a hydrogen economy,the following steps must occur:good research to generate the necessary technological breakthroughs (it's just physics)and good politics/agreement among the users(it's just politics and good business).For it to be other than isolated incidents of hydrogen utilization,the practices need to be stan- dardized across state,region,and national boundaries."}
{"text": "Concern for the future of our planet and the environment has brought hydrogen to the forefront as a method of producing energy.Other environmentally friendly methods incude wind,water,solar,geothermal,and nuclear.Hydrogen leverages the use of renewals as they can be used to produce hydrogen,which can then be transported/used bymultiple methods.It is a“game changer” [4] and as pointed out by many,electricity and hydrogen are comple- mentary.Electricity can be converted to hydrogen,and hydrogen can be converted to elec- tricity.Hydrogen has the additional asset of being useable for nonpower applications (transport,etc.)or to produce power and can be used for\"battery-challenged\"applications [4]."}
{"text": "Achieving the hydrogen economy has many benefits and challenges.This chapter begins with some basic information on the current status of the use and production of hydrogen and finishes with examples from countries around the world."}
{"text": "One of hydrogen's greatest attractions is its presence in water(H₂O),which covers around 71%of the Earth's surface.If hydrogen can be released from water economically, it will be the energy provider of the future and will significantly reduce the Earth's greenhouse emissions.One of its greatest deterrents is its flammability(which,on the positive side,means it is a good fuel).While the flammable limits for a fuel such as natural gas is in the range of 5.0%-15%(gas to air volume ratio),hydrogen has a range from 4.0%to 75.0%.It has a relatively low ignition energy (0.02 mJ)[5]."}
{"text": "A main advantage of using hydrogen to produce,for example,electricity is that it is converted to water by fuel cells,which means it is not considered a pollutant.In addi- tion,it is nontoxic and dissipates rapidly when released.It has NFPA (National Fire Protection Association)ratings (from 0 to 4)of O for health,4 for flammability,and O for instability [5,6]."}
{"text": "Although hydrogen has many uses (e.g.,chemical processes and reactions),this discussion will focus on its use as an energy carrier."}
{"text": "22.2.2 End-use applications\n\nThe world produces about 50 million tonnes of hydrogen a year [7].Until recently (for the past 100 years),the primary uses for hydrogen were for fertilizer production and for hydrocracking.This has changed with the advent of the hydrogen economy.People are now viewing hydrogen as a replacement for fossil fuels."}
{"text": "The distinction must be made between the direct use of hydrogen and the use of hydrogen in fuel cells.For example,hydrogen can be used directly as in combustion in automobiles or power plants,but it can also be used secondarily,as in fuel cells.(Fuel cells will be addressed in another chapter in this volume.)The categories discussed above include both of these applications,sometimes in combination [8,9]."}
{"text": "Larger means of transport such as buses are being demonstrated all over Europe and in the United States,which should lead to greater numbers over the next decade.The use of hydrogen in other vehicles such as forklifts and heavy-duty trucks is increasing and the capital expenditure for hydrogen-powered forklifts is now competitive with battery- powered forklifts [11]."}
{"text": "Trains and light rail are becoming another use for hydrogen,which is also described in Section 22.4.Quebec actually demonstrated the first one in 2002 and Japan in 2006."}
{"text": "Hydrogen-powered boats were of interest at least fifty decades ago and are now receiving renewed interest with the US Navy in submarines,ferries,and other boats.This arena is trailing the others but is picking up momentum."}
{"text": "Although hydrogen has only minimally been considered with regard to flight,it is currently making inroads in the arena of drones and for use(fuel cells),while the airplane is on the ground as a means to reduce fuel consumption."}
{"text": "With regard to the use of hydrogen for power and fuel,it is seeing more applications in the energy sector,in particular as a storage medium after water has been electrolyzed using renewable electricity.Some organizations and nations (see list)are also combining hydrogen with other fuels to produce both power and heat."}
{"text": "22.2.3 The problems\n\nDominant challenges confronting hydrogen include storage issues,purity(for fuel cells), and infrastructure,which includes safety [12].Some of these are being discussed in other sections.Additionally,although hydrogen itself is a\"clean\"energy carrier,other energy sources must be used to produce it.This challenge is being resolved by renewable energy methods such as solar and wind."}
{"text": "22.2.4.2 Security and energy independence\n\nSecurity and energy independence are driving forces for using domestic energy sources."}
{"text": "22.3 Basic elements needed for hydrogen utilization\n\nFor the hydrogen economy to be viable,there are some essential elements that must be addressed.Technically,these are production,distribution,and application.Other essential needs are for safety regulations,codes and standards,education,and dissemination."}
{"text": "22.3.1 Production [18 ]\n\nAlthough hydrogen is the most abundant element on Earth,it normally does not exist in a free state and needs to be extracted from its compounds such as water and natural gas. Hydrogen can be produced from a variety of resources such as water,fossil fuels,and biomass through different methods such as water electrolysis or high-temperature water splitting.One of the reasons for hydrogen as a valuable energy carrier is its diverse production methods.However,considering that the overall energy efficiency and po- tential environmental impact of a hydrogen-based economy depends on its production method,selecting the proper method could be a difficult task.Following are some of the more common hydrogen production methods."}
{"text": "22.3.1.1 Production from fossil fuels [19]\n\nHydrogen production from fossil fuels is an easily accessible form of production as it does not require complicated infrastructure.However,the complexity of the required process varies and significantly affects the production costs.A problem associated with hydrogen production from fossil fuels is CO₂as a by-product,and the need for considering means to capture it."}
{"text": "22.3.1.2 Natural gas reforming [20,21]\n\nNatural gas can be used to produce hydrogen through steam reforming(the most used), partial oxidation,and autothermal reforming.Out of the three,steam reforming is the cheapest and most efficient,which involves the endothermic conversion of methane (or fuels such as ethanol,propane,and gasoline)and high-temperature steam (at 700℃-1000℃).The process needs to be performed in the presence of catalysts at pressures around 3-25 bar.Products of this process are hydrogen,carbon monoxide, and a small amount of carbon dioxide.Then the carbon monoxide and steam undergo another reaction in the presence of a catalyst that produces carbon dioxide and more hydrogen."}
{"text": "In partial oxidation,as the name states,natural gas is exposed to a small amount of oxygen that is not enough to completely oxidize the gas.As a result,a part of the gas is oxidized,and the products are carbon monoxide and hydrogen."}
{"text": "Authothermal reforming,sometimes known as water-gas shift reaction,is a combi- nation of the above two processes.In this process,carbon monoxide (product of partial oxidation)reacts with high-temperature steam to produce more hydrogen.The latter two methods are exothermic,hence a more compact design of the reactor is viable,and no heat input is required."}
{"text": "22.3.1.4 Water splitting [24]\n\nOne of the most accessible hydrogen production methods is to split water into its ele- ments,oxygen,and hydrogen.This can be performed through a variety of technologies including electrolysis or solar thermochemical splitting.While the total required energy for electrolysis increases at higher temperatures,the electrical energy requirement de- creases.Consequently,electrolysis at higher temperatures is desired,where waste heat from different resources can be used as a heat source for the process."}
{"text": "22.3.1.6 High-temperature electrolysis [26]\n\nHigh-temperature electrolysis is based on the technology of high-temperature fuel cells. This technology takes advantage of the fact that the energy requirement for electrolysis is lower at higher temperatures.Consequently,a high-temperature electrolyzer has a higher overall efficiency as compared with the same electrolyzer at lower temperatures. In these systems,heat sources(e.g.,geothermal,solar,or natural gas)other than elec- tricity are considered to reduce the electricity consumption of the system."}
{"text": "22.3.1.7 Photoelectrolysis (photolysis)[27]\n\nAs stated in the previous section,solar is one of the sources of heat that could be in- tegrated with high-temperature electrolysis to reduce the overall electricity consump- tion.An example is a photoelectrolysis(photolysis)system.In photolysis,sunlight is directly utilized to split water.Photolysis offers a great cost advantage as compared with conventional electrolysis technologies."}
{"text": "22.3.1.8 Solar thermochemical hydrogen (STCH)[28]\n\nThis technology is another high-temperature water splitting technology that can use the concentrated solar power high temperature or the waste heat of a nuclear reactor in combination with chemical reactions to produce hydrogen and oxygen.One of the main advantages of this technology is its low greenhouse gas emission.Through solar ther- mochemical hydrogen,high temperatures are used to drive a chemical reaction that splits water.Some of the chemicals used for this purpose are cerium oxide and copper chloride."}
{"text": "22.3.1.9 Photobiological production (biophotolysis)[29]\n\nHydrogen production through biophotolysis includes two steps.The first one is photosynthesis and the second one is hydrogenase-catalyzed hydrogen production.The two options can also be reproduced by deploying artificial photosynthesis.This tech- nology is still under the R&D phase for understanding the natural processes and genetic regulations of hydrogen production."}
{"text": "Generally,biomass gasification is not as easy as coal and has side products that include hydrocarbon compounds.To reduce the emission of carbon compounds,an extra step is required to catalytically capture the generated hydrocarbons through the biomass conversion."}
{"text": "22.3.2.1 Pipeline\n\nPipeline is the least expensive distribution method for delivering high volumes of hydrogen to the user.Hydrogen pipelines have a certain maximum operational pressure of around 100 kPa due to hydrogen's effect on piping materials.Currently,in the United States,there exists less than 2600 km of hydrogen pipeline that mostly extends from a centralized producer to some end users such as petroleum refineries and chemical plants."}
{"text": "22.3.2.2 High-pressure tube trailer\n\nThis is a rather expensive distribution method that includes deploying trucks,railcars, ships,or barges to transport compressed hydrogen gas.It is normally used for delivery distances less than 350 km."}
{"text": "22.3.3 Storage [33,34]\n\nWhen there is a lack of localized hydrogen production and convenient distribution infrastructure,hydrogen storage is a requirement if it is to be successfully implemented. Also,hydrogen storage is required for mobile applications such as on-board hydrogen storage on cars or with fuel cells."}
{"text": "Hydrogen storage can be done in physical form (compressed gas,liquefied)or chemical form (through a chemical reaction)."}
{"text": "22.3.3.1 Physical based [35]\n\nPhysical hydrogen storage is the most mature type of storage technology available to us. From a physical point of view,hydrogen can be stored in any ofits three phases,i.e.,as a compressed gas,liquefied hydrogen,or solid state in hydrogen-absorbing materials. Safety and cost are some of the main challenges with the first two,while the latter is still in R&D phase and not commercialized yet."}
{"text": "22.3.3.1.1 Compressed gas [36]\n\nCompressing hydrogen is the most common method of storage where it is stored under pressures between 350 and 700 bars.The storage tank could be made of steel or light- weight composites.Steel tanks face the dual problems of high weight and hydrogen embrittlement.Lightweight composites,especially carbon fiber tank,are more viable options today and are commercially available.An alternative to compressed gas tech- nology is cryocompressed gas,which takes advantage of both temperature and pressure to achieve a higher volumetric energy density storage system."}
{"text": "22.3.3.1.2 Cryogenic liquid hydrogen [37,38]\n\nThe terms cryogenic hydrogen and liquid hydrogen are interchangeably used to refer to liquefying hydrogen at around 20 K and storing it at that temperature.With a density of 70.8 kg m-³,liquid hydrogen offers a theoretical gravimetric density(wt.%)of 100% compared with a maximum of 20%for other storage methods.Cryogenic hydrogen storage also provides a better energy density compared with compressed gas.However, this method is energy intensive with its requirement for a cryogenic system to liquefy the gas."}
{"text": "22.3.3.2.1 Sorbents [41]\n\nSorbents mostly refers to materials that are used for adsorption of hydrogen. Consequently,parameters such as the material's pore size,pore volume,and surface area affect the binding energies in the system.The hydrogen storage capacity of sorbent- based systems is in an intermediate level between compressed gas and intermetallic compounds (metal hydrides).An advantage of sorbents is that hydrogen remains in its molecular form with a small activation energy rather than the atomic form in absorption. However,adsorption enthalpies are much lower than absorption ones that is a main disadvantage of sorbents in hydrogen storage."}
{"text": "22.3.3.2.2 Metal hydrides [42]\n\nMetal hydrides are groups of materials that are able to reversibly store hydrogen through chemical reactions.They can be used for different hydrogen-related applications including neutron moderation,electrochemical cycling,thermal storage,heat pumps, and purification.They have the advantage of higher volumetric and gravimetric storage densities that are higher than both compressed and liquefied hydrogen storage systems. Some of the issues associated with metal hydride hydrogen storage systems are reaction kinetics,cycle life,and reaction thermodynamics."}
{"text": "22.3.3.2.3 Chemical hydrogen [43]\n\nWhen the hydrogen absorption reaction of an absorbing material takes place in water, hydrogen can be stored in both.This type of hydrogen storage is called chemical hydrogen storage.In chemical hydrogen storage,the chemical hydride can be either a solid or a liquid.A point about chemical hydrides is that unlike metal hydrides,their absorption process needs activation energies higher than what can be merely supplied through hydrogen pressure.Thus,their hydrogenation needs to be performed separately, and as a result,chemical hydrides are mostly preferred for a single-time use rather than the cyclic absorption/desorption of metal hydrides."}
{"text": "22.3.4 Safety:regulations,codes,and standards\n\nHydrogen can be used as fuel,as an energy carrier,or as an industrial chemical.It can be toxic,flammable,and explosive (its specific properties were described in Section 22.2.1). Because it has been in industrial use for more than a century,there are already estab- lished guidelines for its safe utilization [44].However,with the newly developed appli- cations for hydrogen,such as backup generators,high-pressure storage containers on fuel cell vehicles,high-pressure fueling stations,etc.,there is a need for guidelines and safety requirements appropriate for untrained personnel and the public.Because training in other fuels cannot be directly applied to hydrogen,these new applications could either damage or be damaged by an uninformed or untrained person if the appropriate safety guidelines are not established."}
{"text": "As mentioned in the previous edition of this volume,UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization)compares gasoline,methane,and hydrogen as fuels and concludes hydrogen is the most desirable [45].The multitude of possible uses for hydrogen and the large number of countries beginning to include hydrogen in their infrastructure preclude any detailed discussion of regulations,codes,and standards in this chapter.In hydrogen storage alone,for example,the regulations would have to include containment,safety relief,piping/tubing/fittings,equipment assembly,instal- lation,storage containers and housing,securing,marking/labeling,testing after instal- lation,location,and other specific requirements."}
{"text": "Because the use of hydrogen has increased over the past decade,many of the hurdles are being overcome by new safety policies for production,distribution,storage and use, and training of emergency personnel.This involves collaboration among a variety of entities including standards and development organizations,government,industry, universities,and researchers.Some of the many uses of hydrogen around the globe are given in Section 22.4.Recommended websites give the contact information for inter- national and some national organizations that can provide additional material con- cerning their particular codes,standards,and practices [46]."}
{"text": "22.3.4.1 Material considerations\n\nWhether hydrogen is used for production,transport,storage,or directly,there are two primary safety considerations:when kept as a liquid at cryogenic temperatures,it pre- sents the usual problems of operating some materials below their ductile to brittle transition,and when kept as a gas,it can result in hydrogen embrittlement."}
{"text": "Although the specific mechanisms producing hydrogen embrittlement are still being investigated,it is known three variables are involved:the susceptible material,the environment,and the presence or absence of stresses.Hydrogen can interact with the material on the surface orin the bulk,so the compatibility of the material with hydrogen must be considered (for more detailed discussion,see BRHS in Chapter 3 [47])."}
{"text": "A third consideration with regard to safety and hydrogen is the size of the hydrogen molecule.Unlike the other gaseous energy carriers,hydrogen is small enough to pass through cracks and joints,and as it is odorless,tasteless,and colorless,it is not readily detected.If it accumulates in a confined space,it can either reach a flammable con- centration and/or also act as an asphyxiant\n\nHydrogen has a very small Joule-Thomson inversion factor,i.e.,it warms up when expanded at constant enthalpy.On the other side,hydrogen is flammable in concen- tration ranges from 4%to 75%in air with explosion ranges from 18%to 60%.These two facts conclude that,in practice,hydrogen/air mixture is at least a flammable mixture that can start burning with a small initial energy(e.g.,through hydrogen expansion due to leakage)."}
{"text": "22.3.5 Education and dissemination\n\nAs the interest in and usage of hydrogen increases,the necessity for education also in- creases.Education must take place on at least four fronts:continuing education,grade school and high school,the university,and training.Each of these targets requires a different approach,which respects the technical level of the learner.According to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy of the DOE,the key target audiences are students,teachers,state and local government representatives,safety and code of- ficials,and potential commercial end users.The general public should also be included in that target as in many instances,it will be their conception of hydrogen that will dictate whether or not the hydrogen economy becomes real."}
{"text": "In Europe,the fuel cell and hydrogen technology industry has acknowledged the need for trained staff.TeacHy2020 addresses this need at the university level by developing a repository of educational material and an MSc course in FCHT (Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Technology),which is accessible all over Europe.Professional development will be included.The Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking(FCH JU)is a joint undertaking that requires a comprehensive communication plan giving the target audiences for funded projects and the methodology for reaching these audiences.Their projects are aimed at citizens,decision-makers,and other key audiences,with the idea being to show the leverage effects and the impact on daily lives and society."}

{"text": "23.2.1 General information\n\nInside a fuel cell,hydrogen together with oxygen or rather air is converted to steam.For this,two electrodes (the anode and cathode)are set into an electrolyte.A basic sche- matic is shown in Fig.23.1 [6]."}
{"text": "Compared to thermal engines,fuel cells have the advantage of a direct conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy.Thermal engines have to convert the chemical energy into thermal and mechanical energy by the combustion of fuel.The mechanical energy is then used to operate a generator,while the thermal energy remains unused in many applications.Consequently,the theoretical efficiency of fuel cells is much better compared to thermal engines as the theoretically achievable useful work is limited solely by the free enthalpy of the chemical reaction and can therefore be higher than the coupling of a thermal engine (limited by carnot efficiency)with a generator for power generation.Furthermore,since thermal engines mostly use fossil fuels,undesirable emissions can be avoided [7]."}
{"text": "Another advantage is the storage density of the chemical fuel (e.g.,hydrogen)."}
{"text": "Compared to electric energy storages like batteries and recharge cycles,refueling times, and self-discharge are significantly reduced.Hence,applications that require long opera- tion times with short downtimes between operation intervals are more likely to use fuel cells instead of batteries,as,for example,trucks [8,9]."}
{"text": "The main disadvantages,especially in terms of using hydrogen as fuel,are that hydrogen is difficult to store,currently expensive when produced from renewables(e.g. electrolysis),and investment costs for fuel cells are relatively high compared to batteries and thermal engines [10]."}
{"text": "The bipolar plates represent the outer part of the fuel cell stack and are therefore responsible for different functionalities.They have to hold the mechanical structure and separate the feed streams.Further,a high electrical and thermal conductivity is important to lead the electrons from one electrode to the other and to allow system cooling [15]."}
{"text": "23.2.3 Phosphoric acid fuel cell\n\nPhosphoric acid fuel cells(PAFCs)typically work at temperatures of about 200℃,at atmospheric pressure with an electric efficiency of approx.40%.The electrodes are mainly based on Pt,Fe,or Co as catalyst combined with PTFE,which is set on carbon paper as a support.The electrodes separate the gas chamber from the electrolyte; consequently,they need to be hydrophobic.The used electrolyte is phosphoric acid. Current research is focused on increasing system stability and lifetime,which is at this time a problem due to corrosion [16]."}
{"text": "Another advantage is its compatibility with biogases.In contrast to PEMFCs,SOFCs can use methane and therefore biogas or carbon monoxide rich synthesis gas from solid biomass gasification as a renewable alternative to natural gas as fuel and are not bound to hydrogen.This electrochemical reaction is described in Eqs.(23.9)and(23.10).In case of a CO,H₂,and CO₂mixture from gasification,the water gas shift reaction has to be considered as well Eq.(23.11),[18]."}
{"text": "Instead of a solid electrolyte like in PEMFC,alkaline fuel cell uses a liquid.The most common electrolyte for this application is potassium hydroxide(KOH)with a concen- tration of about 30%in aqueous solution.In the fuel cell chamber,the electrolyte is separated from the gas flows by the electrodes,which have a thickness of 0.2-0.5 mm. The electrodes consist of two layers,an active electrocatalyst layer and a hydrophobic layer to prevent electrolyte leaking to the gas flow.It is normally operated at tempera- tures of about 100℃ and a pressure of 4 bar [21]."}
{"text": "MCFC are typically operated at temperatures above 600℃ and a pressure of 1 bar with natural gas or hydrogen.The occurring electrochemical reactions are shown in Eqs.(23.14)and (23.15).MCFCs are not damaged by the presence of CO or CO₂.Due to the higher operating temperature MCFCs allow the use of nonprecious metals as cata- lyst,like Ni.Electrolytes are made of carbonates as,for example,lithium and potassium carbonate and are solid at room temperature but liquid at operating temperature.A main advantage of MCFCs is that it can be used for CO₂separation from fossil fuel power plants [24,25]."}
{"text": "Since SOFC can be powered with H₂,CH₄,and CO hydrocarbons can be reformed, which is a process that can be done very efficiently due to the high operating temper- atures.The reforming process can be internal and external.However,in case of fossil natural gas reforming,a desulphurization has to be integrated in the system before reforming [27]."}
{"text": "A novel approach in power-to-gas technologies,which is very similar to the previ- ously mentioned reforming of hydrocarbons,uses a reversible solid oxide cell (ReSOC)to produce gases which can be stored as chemical energy carrier and thus comparable to pumped hydrostorage system.It consists of a ReSOC and methanation unit combined with separate CO2 and CH₄underground storage caverns(see Fig.23.2)[28]."}
{"text": "This system proposes roundtrip efficiencies of up to 70%due to the thermal coupling of the ReSOC and the methanation reactor.During electricity surplus,the system pro- duces hydrogen as electrolyzer,which is later methanized and stored.In case of elec- tricity demand,the ReSOC is operated as a fuel cell and converts methane and oxygen into steam and CO₂,which is afterward separated and the CO₂stored in a cavern [28]."}
{"text": "losses due to irreversibilities in the gas turbine process.The efficiency of a combined gas turbine SOFC system could reach up to 60%.The main components of such a system, beside an SOFC and gas turbine,would be an air compressor,recuperator,combustor, and power turbine.Such a system with a direct integration of the gas turbine is shown\n\nin Fig.23.3 [27]."}
{"text": "A wide variety of technology options are available for electric energy storage.One is a regenerative hydrogen fuel cell(RHFC)system that converts electricity to hydrogen by water electrolysis,stores the hydrogen,and later provides it to a fuel cell to generate electric power.Even at its present-day round-trip efficiency of 30%,however,it can provide the same overall energy benefit as batteries when storing surplus power from wind farms [29].A schematic illustration of a regenerative hydrogen fuel cell system is provided in Fig.23.4."}
{"text": "Fuel cells cannot store energy in the way a battery does but it can be stored as hydrogen.In some applications,such as stand-alone power plants based on discontin- uous sources such as solar or wind power,they can potentially be combined with electrolyzers and storage systems to form an energy storage system.The electrolyzer/fuel cell system can theoretically store indefinite quantities of hydrogen,and is therefore suited for long-term storage."}
{"text": "Fuel cell vehicles usually use hydrogen to power an electric engine-directly or by charging a battery—although several manufacturers have also proven a fuel cell vehicle with methanol.The most common fuel cell technology for this usage is the PEMFC [32]. The hydrogen is stored in a pressurized tank (up to 800 bar).As standard,70MPa (700 bar)pressure tanks are used on cars and 35MPa(350 bar)pressure tanks on buses. The pressure tank used has a significant influence on the range of the vehicles.Several hydrogen refueling stations have been built worldwide in the last decade [33].The operating temperature of a motor vehicle fuel cell is between 60 and 80℃ since the use of the polymer membrane limits the temperature to below 100℃."}
{"text": "Other mobility applications such as buses,have successfully demonstrated the use of fuel cells for transport whereas the energy demand,space availability,operating behavior due to multiple stops and starts as well as refueling options differ from cars. Further commercially available fuel cell vehicles include scooters and bicycles but hydro- gen storage remains an issue for these vehicles.For these applications metal hydrides, sodium borohydride,zinc,and methanol have been investigated as chemical energy carrier over the past decade [36]."}
{"text": "23.3.3.2 Backup power supply\n\nBackup power supply systems provide power when the primary power source is interrupted,e.g.,information technology services,telecommunication,emergency power generators.For these applications,PEM pressurized hydrogen fuel cell is the most popular type of fuel cell used.There are many fuel options such as compressed or liquefied hydrogen,propane,natural gas,and others.An electrolyzer system is a good option for backup power applications as it can produce hydrogen on demand."}
{"text": "The electrolyzer can be powered by electricity from solar panels,a wind source,a nu- clear source or electricity from the local grid.In hybrid energy systems,fuel cells can be connected to photovoltaics,batteries,condensers,or wind turbines that supply primary or secondary electricity [38]."}
{"text": "23.4 Environmental impact analysis\n\nThis section provides an overview on the environmental benefits and drawbacks of fuel cells with focus on application in transport.Basically most fuel cell vehicles or stationary options entail significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impact categories especially compared with conventional gasoline ve- hicles or power supply systems.Nevertheless,this is not always the case especially if fossil resources are the feedstock for the fuel production and emissions are additionally generated in the fuel cell production.In Section 23.4.2,the environmental benefits of using renewable hydrogen in fuel cells were identified,however,reducing the environ- mental impact associated with the manufacture of fuel cell vehicles still represent an important challenge that need to be addressed in future years [41]."}

{"text": "Concerning fuel cell electric vehicles,these impacts are mainly caused by the carbon fibers for fuel onboard storage,PTFEmaterials for membranes or platinum group metals for the catalyst and,to a lesser degree,the materials and energy for the flow field plates [44] ."}
{"text": "Based on the strong impact of the vehide use phase over the whole lifetime,it is also important to take losses due to fuel production,transportation,and storage into account. The GWP of the disposal phase was shown of minor relevance for the assessed tech- nologies.Consequently,it can be stated that the so-called“green”vehicles like FCEVs can only achieve their full potential in terms of GHG reduction by using environmental friendly fuels (i.e.,electricity from wind,PV and hydropower or bio-hydrogen as primary energy source)."}
{"text": "23.4.2 Influence of fuel sourcing on the environment\n\nHydrogen is an abundant constituent element in water,biomass,and fossil hydrocar- bons.The greenhouse gas intensity (and other environmental impacts)of hydrogen production depends on the sources and processes through which the hydrogen is derived.It can be extracted from water using electrolysis,powered by renewable solar or wind,nuclear energy,or fossil energy.It can be extracted from renewable biomass or coal using high temperature gasification.Today,most hydrogen is derived from fossil natural gas as a standard industrial chemical commodity,emitting fossil carbon dioxide as a by- product in the same quantities as would be generated when burning it.The life cycle assessment (LCA)of power-to-gas as given by Reiter et al. [48] showed that the electricity input is the most influencing parameter on the ecological performance of electrolysis plants.The influence of the electricity input on the global warming potential(GWP)of H₂ produced via water electrolysis(so called power-to-gas)are shown in Fig.23.6."}
{"text": "If renewable electricity is utilized for hydrogen production via electrolysis,the GWP is significantly lower than for the fossil benchmark technology steam reforming.However, if the electricity mix of the EU-27 countries is utilized,the GWP is significantly higher. This means that hydrogen production via electrolysis leads to increased greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions in comparison with steam reforming of natural gas or crude oil."}
{"text": "23.5.1 System costs and cost development\n\nAs for many energy technologies,the capital or investment costs for fuel cell systems are highly dependent on the appropriate use.The specific system costs related to the electric power of the fuel cell are influenced by various different parameters."}
{"text": "The nominal system capacity has a major influence on the specific investment costs as scaling effects come into account.According to the cell stack,this scaling is mainly driven by so-called“scale-up by number-up”,which means,that system capacity is increased by using repeat cells [20].Therefore,scaling effects on fuel cell stacks are primarily dominated by increased production capacities and effectivity."}
{"text": "Another major aspect is the comparatively low readiness level(TRL)of the tech- nology as a whole,or rather the low level of commercialization.According to the theory of technological learning,production costs for a certain technology are reduced with increasing amounts of cumulatively produced units [20].Therefore,high investment costs are expected to significantly decrease with increasing commercialization and market penetration."}
{"text": "Looking at smaller scale applications or rather nonautomotive fuel cells,capital costs have also decreased significantly over the recent years.System costs for back-up power applications in a scale of 5 kW have already reached values of 2200EkW-¹and below. For combined heat and power(CHP)systems,specific investment costs are significantly higher,reaching values of about 5500∈kW-¹for systems up to 10 kW,while costs for larger scale applications (100 kW-5 MW)are relatively wide spread from hundreds to thousands of Euros per kilowatt hour depending on complexity of the system [49]."}
{"text": "¹Average exchange rate for EUR/USD in 2010 of 1.33 used."}
{"text": "Analyzing cost reductions through technological learning of fuel cells for small domestic-scale CHP applications in the range of 1 kW,a reduction of the price below 750∈kW-¹is unlikely to be reached in the near future.Whereas a long-term target of 2250-3750EkW-¹is more realistic at the current rate of progress [26,50].²\n\nRecent investigations on learning curves in the CHP sector have shown that for PEMFCs each doubling in production has seen prices fall by 16%-21%for residential generators.For MCFC and SOFC systems of 200-250 kW class,learning rates of 5% and -2%,respectively,are observed [50].Therefore,a high market penetration is potentially leading to significantly reduced prices in future for PEMFC systems,while stagnating for others,according to these rates of technological learning."}
{"text": "23.5.2 Operating and auxiliary costs\n\nOperating costs for fuel cell systems are generally dependent on durability and main- tenance efforts.On the mobility sector,FCEV applications are very reliable today,due to intense development over the past 20 years,reaching availabilities of 94%in passenger cars and values up to 94%in FC driven buses.Additionally,lifetime has increased from a few hundred operating hours at beginning of the century to numbers ranging between 6000 and 7000 operating hours for passenger cars and 12,000h and above for buses [2,50].Compared to powertrains with internal combustion engines (ICE),maintenance costs for FCEV are significantly lower [50].Together with high efficiencies compared to conventional ICE [20]and low refueling times in the range of minutes and high driving ranges up to 700 km [2]in comparison to battery electric vehicles (BEV)available today, fuel cells provide a competitive alternative in the automotive sector."}
{"text": "Looking at CHP applications,fuel cells provide low emission (of pollutants as well as noise)and high efficiency alternatives to ICE-CHP systems,especially in consideration of stationary solid oxide fuel cells with increased electrical efficiencies of about 40%-60%. While currently costs of residential systems are dominated by capital and stack\n\nreplacement costs,itis expected that fuel cell micro-CHP could be cost competitive with ²Average exchange rate for EUR/USD in 2013 of 1.33 used."}
{"text": "Altogether,operating costs for fuel cells are,besides replacement costs,dominated by the fuels being used.With fuels used today and hydrogen production mainly covered from fossils,these fuel costs are mainly driven by natural gas costs.The future genera- tion of renewable fuels for fuel cell applications will have its effect on costs [51].In this context,SOFC system are at an advantage compared to competing technologies as they are less sensitive to the fuel used [50].Therefore,lower grade fuels with higher shares of impurities,like biogas,are potentially being used as renewable alternative at lower costs."}
{"text": "23.5.3 Market development\n\nAn observation of market development shows that stationary application are currently the most important market for fuel cells,according to the number of units shipped,while installations in the mobility sector are increasing steadily and leading in terms of installed power [3].Looking at the fuel cell market for residential CHP systems,fuel cells outsold engine-based micro-CHP systems in 2012 for the first time,taking more than 60%of the global market.As of October 2017,Japan has deployed 98%of the world's fuel cell systems, primarily for single-family homes,with more than 220,000 systems,aiming a govern- mental target of 1.4 million fuel cells installed by 2020.In comparison,South Korea and Europe trail by a decade and the US market has seen very limited uptake [2,50]."}
{"text": "In the field of transport and mobility applications for fuel cells,North America is the leading market with around 20,000 units deployed,especially for material handling ve- hicles (MHV)in a number of different sites e.g.,harbors,airports,industrial and logistic sites.Based on that success in the US market,forklifts are currently also approaching market introduction in Europe,with the first few hundreds of units being deployed through FCH JU projects [2].The United States is also the leading market on fuel cell driven passenger cars.With a total amount of over 2700 cars sold as of 2017,more vehicles have been sold than on the Japanese and European markets combined.In comparison to battery electric vehicles,costs for FCEVare still relatively high.However,with an uptake of mass production,they can potentially achieve parity to battery electric vehicles (BEVs)by 2025-30.Higher driving range and shorter refueling time are an advantageous aspect in that context,especially for buses,heavy goods and other highly utilized vehicles [50]."}
{"text": "Given a sustained policy support,together with the intense research and resulting technological progress in hydrogen and fuel cell development in the recent years,fuel cells are supposed to experience a cost and performance trajectory similar to those of photovoltaics and batteries.According to the reports on the use of fuel cells across the energy system,the technology is able to provide an additional important and low-carbon option in the medium term [50]."}
{"text": "In order to achieve a broad market penetration a further challenge is the distribution infrastructure especially for fuel cell vehicles.Currently there are only few hydrogen gas stations where fuel cell vehicles could be refilled.Moreover,hydrogen is distributed by trucks or ships,which carry hydrogen in tanks or bottles under high pressure or in cryogenic tanks.Consequently,the distributed amount of hydrogen is very limited and does not allow for the distribution of large quantities.However,countries like Germany and Japan have recently started an offensive to establish a refilling infrastructure,with sufficient locations and capacity [33].Furthermore,it should be avoidable to build a completely new pipeline system parallel to the natural gas grid by distributing and storing a significant amount of hydrogen via the gas grid [52].Current regulations allow only small amounts(depending on the country)of hydrogen as part of the gas mixture. However,publications have shown the possibility of mixing up to 20%hydrogen into the gas grid without having the risk of material or system damages [53].Hence,part of a solution for the distribution system would be in a first step to allow higher percentages of hydrogen mixed into the gas grid.This would make the refilling of gas stations much easier and would allow off-site hydrogen driven power plants.Besides the technical challenges,also preconceptions concerning safety related to hydrogen as fuel must be considered.This can be overcome e.g.,for tanks as they are made of high-strength composite materials and put through rigorous testing and strong performance re- quirements [54]."}
{"text": "Further sociopolitical challenges would be to inform the public about the positive aspects of fuel cell technology;this is particularly important in the mobility sector where, for example,hydrogen fueled cars are often seen as dangerous due to the explosive nature of the gas.It would also be necessary to encourage industries out of fossil re- sources and into a more hydrogen-based technology."}

{"text": "A prospective approach to addressing the shortcomings of solar power due to nighttime,weather,and atmospheric losses is to collect the sunlight in space and transmit it wirelessly to the ground.Using satellites to accomplish this would potentially add the benefit of global power distribution without building conventional physical grid infrastructure.The concept,described in science fiction in 1941 by Isaac Asimov in his short story“Reason”and in the journal Science in 1968 by Peter Glaser in his article \"Power from the Sun:Its Future,\"has been studied episodically.The vision of a means of essentially unlimited energy for civilization has proved compelling to many researchers and space advocates for decades:the possibility of harnessing the sunlight of space, brighter than anywhere on earth,for clean,constant,globally transmissible energy."}
{"text": "Such a system would be comprised of elements similar to those of existing space systems:a space segment and a ground segment.The space segment would likely be on a scale not previously seen,perhaps with a structure or structures of the order of kilo- meters.The ground segment might also be measured in kilometers.The ultimate sizes of the system elements would depend on the amount of power to be collected and trans- mitted,and on the means of power transmission.For systems envisioned using the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum for power transmission,the nature of diffraction-limited optics necessitates very large apertures for efficient beam collection if the spacecraft is in geosynchronous orbit,with the required sizes becoming smaller for lower orbits.Other sections of the electromagnetic spectrum have received attention for power beaming as well,including the millimeter wave and optical regions.Shorter wavelengths permit higher beam collection efficiencies while shrinking the required aperture sizes,but would present higher power densities for equal amounts of power to be transmitted,and generally will be subject to greater weather and atmospheric attenuation.For orbits lower than geosynchronous,the benefit of constant ground coverage for a fixed region is lost and a constellation of multiple satellites may be needed."}
{"text": "24.2 Perspective\n\nSince its introduction,the advantages of space solar have drawn the attention of many in search of clean baseload energy solutions.Light from the sun is more intense in space because the light is not attenuated by clouds or the atmosphere;hence,a satellite in geosynchronous orbit is illuminated essentially year-round,whereas terrestrial solar power systems must contend with seasonal sunlight variation and nighttime.Widely recognized as physically possible but economically prohibitive,interest in space solar power has resurged in recent years as a consequence of increased media attention resulting from government and nongovernmental organization reports,as well as through efforts by private companies and national space agencies to develop or stim- ulate the development of practical space solar power systems.Thoughtful and reasoned criticisms [1,2]and countercriticisms [3]have offered excellent summary insights into some of the major challenges and have tended to focus principally on the formidable economic challenges."}
{"text": "Following Glaser's initial patent [4] and article in Science,major funded studies have been conducted by:the US Department of Energy (DOE)and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA)during the 1970s [5];the National Research Council in 1981 [6];and again by NASA in 1995 and 1999 in the form of the \"Fresh Look\"study [7]; and the Space Solar Power Exploratory Research and Technology (SERT)program [8]."}
{"text": "Many different approaches to space solar have been proposed.Fundamentally,each has a means of solar energy collection and a method for conveying the collected energy to the ground.For collection,only photovoltaics and solar thermal systems have,in principal,been considered.For transmission,microwave frequencies and lasers have been examined.Solar-pumped lasers and large spaceborne mirrors have been proposed as combined collection and transmission schemes.Each collection and transmission scheme offers distinct advantages and disadvantages.Photovoltaics(PV)are considered for their comparative reliability and simplicity,while solar thermal is advocated for its theoretical ability to achieve efficiencies transcending the Shockley-Queisser limit [23] that bounds PV.Laser transmission is cited for its ability to utilize smaller transmitter and receiver apertures,whereas microwave transmission is favored for its greatly reduced susceptibility to attenuation from tropospheric effects.Microwave power transmission has been investigated extensively for space solar power applications and enjoys many decades of terrestrial demonstrations,as documented in detail by William Brown [24]."}
{"text": "Several dozen major classes of SPS architectures have been proposed by different researchers.Most employ PV for solar energy collection and microwave power trans- mission to deliver the energy to the earth,especially those that depend on the utilization of “sandwich”modules.The attraction to this specific approach can be appreciated by examining some selected forerunners and understanding their limitations and challenges."}

{"text": "The DOE/NASA reference system approach and its derivative versions fall within the \"perpendicular to orbital plane\"class of SPS.For each perpendicular to orbital plane concept,the solar collection surface rotates on an axis perpendicular to the orbital plane in order to track the sun and the collected energy is routed to one or more transmission antennas that point at the earth to direct the energy beam.The collection surface and the plane containing the antenna aperture must necessarily be pointed independently of each other,necessitating the aforementioned slip ring mechanism or some other means of energy redirection.Naturally,wiring to route the power around the satellite must be employed and this wiring contributes to an undesirable increase in the overall spacecraft mass.The slip ring mechanism poses intrinsic reliability concerns as a potential single point of failure,especially at high operating powers.These shortcomings led researchers to investigate alternatives,like the Chinese Academy of Space Technology's “Multi- Rotary Joints SPS\" [31] and those that use“sandwich\"modules,which address these possibly crippling problems."}
{"text": "The lower of these functional layers can be further divided into subfunctions that are anticipated to be needed for a module that would be deployed in practice.In the direct current to radiofrequency (DC-to-RF)conversion layer,the subfunctions include DC power conversion,incorporation of frequency and phase information for beam control, RF amplification and phase shifting,and output filtering.In the antenna layer,in addition to the elements to transmit the power beam,there would likely be separate elements to receive the pilot signal to be used to control beam pointing,perhaps ret- rodirectively.This pointing method has been demonstrated to be safe and effective on many occasions and is described in Ref.[33].Fig.24.4 shows a depiction of the sub- functions in context.Note that the input sunlight could be any of a range of concen- trations,depending on the system implementation."}
{"text": "Maynard pointed out that an advantage of the solid-state amplifiers over vacuum devices is that they do not require high voltages.The many thousands of volts needed for magnetrons and klystrons are difficult to manage in the space environment and necessitate the inclusion of high voltage power converters,introducing another source of conversion inefficiency.Among the issues and possible resolutions Maynard summa- rizes,charged particle radiation effects and topological considerations stand out as some that specific part selection and module fabrication could address in a tangible fashion."}
{"text": "Because of the complexities associated with addressing every possible functional aspect of a sandwich module,many prototypes to date have focused on the most fundamental conversion elements.To this end,functions like implementing retro- directive beam control,phase shifting,output filtering,and actual antenna radiating are not always implemented,and may instead envisioned for future prototypes.Variations of the typical flat or \"tile\"sandwich modules have been proposed,including\"step\"and other shaped modules [38]."}
{"text": "Architectures that employ sandwich modules incude those based heavily on modular system elements,such as the Modular Symmetrical Concentrator(MSC),a derivative of the Integrated Symmetrical Concentrator concept [40],and the SPS-Arbitrarily Large Phased Array(ALPHA)concept [41].These approaches utilize optical energy routing and a microwave transmit aperture constructed from essentially identical elements.This avoids a large,conductive rotating joint and limits wiring mass compared to historical reference concepts.The use of modular elements offers the possibility of economy through mass production.Employing solar concentration could reduce the required launch mass and as a result lower the system cost,but it increases the magnitude of the thermal challenges.A depiction of a proposed MSC satellite is shown in Fig.24.6.Though this image shows a monolithic structure,it could also be possible to use several satellites flying in formation to dispense with the connecting structures,along the lines of what is described in a patent filed by principals from Solaren [42]."}

{"text": "Many other solar power satellite concepts have been developed and studied,some entailing the use of lunar or asteroidal materials to minimize the mass needed to be launched from Earth,such as Peter Schubert's Tin Can SPS [46].The vast majority employ microwave power transmission,the theory of which has been definitively chronicled,and which enjoys numerous instances of practical demonstration.However, concepts using laser transmission have been investigated as well,in part because the shorter wavelengths result in smaller transmit and receive apertures,and consequently smaller and lighter satellites versus those using microwave power transmission.One such concept,developed by the Aerospace Corporation,is shown in Fig.24.10.A2001 Aerospace Corporation study commissioned by NASA found that laser-based space solar offers many potential advantages over microwave-based systems [47],results affirmed by a 2009 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory commissioned by DOE [48]."}
{"text": "Higher frequencies are attractive to reduce the transmit and receive antenna aperture sizes,but other factors besides link coupling,safety,and power density must be considered.These include atmospheric attenuation and device efficiencies at the selected frequency.Atmospheric and rain attenuation increase significantly above 10 GHz,resulting in a tradeoff between antenna size and link availability.At optical wavelengths,atmospheric losses are again lower,but transmissions will be more affected by clouds and precipitation.Fig.24.11 shows relative atmospheric opacity,with losses arising from water vapor and dry air clear sky attenuation."}
{"text": "24.4.1 Transmitter efficiency\n\nIn the intervening years since the DOE/NASA studies first considered solid-state con- version,solid state amplifiers have shown significant performance improvements,and results have been reported by Schmelzer and Long.Their achievement was a GaN HEMT Class F amplifier configuration with greater than 80%power added efficiency (PAE)at 16.5W output power [58].Their results were obtained with commercial Cree transistors operating at 2GHz on hybrid printed circuit boards.If efficiencies resembling these could be implemented in a conversion module,the task of keeping the junction tem- perature lower would be simplified.A key point to recognize is that while the efficiency of the single device that Schmelzer and Long was impressive,the level of electronic RF gain likely needed in a conversion module would probably exceed the gain value they achieved by more than 20 dB,depending on the frequency source employed.Similarly, while Yamanaka's group achieved 70%PAE for 7W output at 5.8 GHz,their gain was only about 10 dB [59].Note that Yamanaka's effort specifically targeted the space solar application.Prior surveys of progress in GaN illuminate the broad scope of work being done in this area [60]."}
{"text": "Vacuum electronics devices have shown efficiencies often exceeding 70%,and have been mass-produced in instances such as the common microwave oven magnetron. Gyrotrons,traveling wave tube amplifiers,klystrons,and other vacuum devices have also been explored for use in solar power satellite systems,but in general they have lower specific power,and require high voltages to operate,which could impose an additional mass penalty for power conversion [13]."}
{"text": "Lasers,particularly fiber lasers,have demonstrated enormous efficiency gains in the last decade,and enjoy widespread industrial use for many applications.Wall-plug effi- ciencies for commercially available laser systems now exceed 50%[61],and individual laser diodes have been reported as high as 83.5%[62].However,the efficiency of laser systems varies greatly with wavelength,and space-qualified laser systems have yet to become commonplace."}

{"text": "application.It may be possible to use the land on which a rectenna receiver is located for colocated additional purposes,such as agriculture,raising of livestock,or conventional solar energy collection,though meaningful prototypes have yet to be demonstrated."}
{"text": "For laser reception,ground receivers could resemble existing photovoltaic panel installations,but would most likely consist of cells that were designed to match the transmission wavelength of the laser.This allows for much greater conversion efficiency than PV for solar,because the devices only need convert a tiny sliver of the spectrum, and can be optimized to do so.Recent efforts in the development of band-gap tuned photovoltaics for laser conversion have demonstrated efficiencies in excess of 70%, nearing the efficiencies of rectennas [67]."}
{"text": "24.5.3 Combined conversion efficiency\n\nThe efficiency of space segment is of great interest in that higher efficiencies help alleviate thermal dissipation problems by constraining the amount of heat that needs to be rejected.Though the solar cells are quite efficient,there is a penalty,the“packing factor\",in any solar panel implementation for the areas on the panel that are not covered with cells.Hence,the panel efficiency is lower than the cell efficiency.The manufac- turer's quoted cell efficiency is for the bare cell;addition of a cover glass will reduce cell efficiency by about 0.5%,depending on the cover glass thickness.Also,unless the array is operated at the maximum power point on its I-V curve,the effective efficiency will be lower than the panel's maximum.To date,sunlight-to-microwave conversion effi- ciencies,of the order of 8%,have been demonstrated in vacuum."}
{"text": "With the advent of \"new space\"and the proliferation of Silicon Valley space startups, we are also witnessing a renaissance on the spacecraft development side.The capabil- ities and quantities of spacecraft now on orbit,that have been emplaced by emerging players such as Planet Labs and Spire,are essentially without precedent.On February 15, 2017 Planet Labs launched an astonishing 88 satellites on a single launch [73].At the conclusion of 2017,they had a fleet exceeding 200 satellites [74].By employing mass production techniques,Planet Labs,OneWeb,and others have driven down the cost per unit mass of spaceflight hardware to previously unheard of levels,into the range of perhaps $5000 per kilogram [75,76].This and further reductions in cost have a direct bearing on the prospective price of electricity that could be provided by solar power satellites,as they would be constructed out of modular elements having many com- monalities with today's small satellites."}

{"text": "Another set of key developments with importance to space solar's feasibility concerns space robotics and autonomous systems.Whereas Glaser's concept required large col- onies of astronauts to live and work in the hazardous conditions of geosynchronous orbit,ongoing projects in space robotics by DARPA and NASA may unleash a revolution of teleoperated and autonomous systems in space [78].This could enable the con- struction of huge structures like those needed for space solar."}
{"text": "As the world faces the formidable perils posed by increasing demands for energy,the reality of global warming and climate change,and the geopolitical complexities of the existing energy paradigm,prospective solutions must be carefully examined.The promise of the capability presented by space solar is tantalizing:clean,constant,globally transmissible,effectively unlimited energy.A country that masters it might become a clean energy leader of the world,with resulting benefits in technological spinoffs,in- dustrial base enhancement,jobs creation,and an opportunity to use power provision as a diplomatic and development implement."}
{"text": "History is built upon contingencies,and in another 50 years we might or might not live in a world in which a portion of our earthbound energy use comes from orbiting spacecraft.But without the foresight,boldness,and vision to explore this possibility,we could well instead find ourselves in much the same place we are today."}

{"text": "The conditions required for fusion are found throughout the universe.Hydrogen,the lightest element,is the most common and clusters together under gravity into clouds, and as the cloud becomes denser and denser under gravity,eventually,the pressure rises high enough for the hydrogen to begin to fuse together to form helium.This is the start of a chain of reactions which can result in the formation of heavier and heavier elements, although the conditions required for the heaviest to form only occur during the most spectacular stellar deaths:a star like our sun will make the carbon that forms diamonds when it dies,but to make gold requires a supernova."}
{"text": "This (D-D)reaction is routinely achieved in current fusion experiments (Section 6)."}
{"text": "Since large-scale evacuation of the public in response to an incident is known to be high risk(e.g.,as observed for Fukushima [2]),the design goal for a fusion power plant is zero-evacuation-that is,even under the worst conceivable series of system failures,the amount of released radioactive material should not be enough to require evacuation of any surrounding area [3].Nuclear regulation requires a\"defense in depth\"approach and fusion is no different:for example,it is possible that a plasma disruption could melt part of the interior of the reactor,rupturing coolant channels in the blanket and causing the release of tritiated steam at high pressure into the reactor.Safety engineers model such events and the resulting pressure rises in the components to calculate where to install rupture disks,expansion volumes,and condensation tanks to ensure the release would be safely contained with no risk of tritium leakage beyond a primary containment level-and in case,this also failed,there is also secondary containment [4]."}
{"text": "While these basic fuel resources appear more or less unlimited,there are other potentially scarce resources which must be considered.Such elements include supplies of tantalum (an alloying element in low-activation steels),beryllium,tungsten (for plasma-facing surfaces),and helium."}
{"text": "25.2.3 Compatibility with existing infrastructure\n\nBeyond the question of regulation what are the technological issues related to fitting fusion power into the existing(or a future)electrical grid?From the outside,a fusion power station is similar to a fission power station:it has(probably)steady,substantial electrical output and will require supplies of a secondary coolant such as river or seawater,which will affect the siting.Two problems relatively unique to fusion which must be considered are startup and shutdown of the plasma.The first requires considerable temporary power input to ramp up the magnet and plasma currents and heat the plasma to fusion conditions.This power,which may be hundreds of megawatts, could be drawn directly from the grid,or could be spread over a greater time period through the use of short-term energy storage such as flywheels(as used on the JET experiment).It is an issue for negotiation with grid operators as to what is tolerable,as it would be a problem if the grid cannot easily supply the start-up power.Furthermore,in the event of an emergency shutdown(due to a plasma control issue,say),a substantial power source would be suddenly removed from the grid which could cause instabilities. Models taking into account the properties of fusion show that this places a maximum output on a single reactor of around 1.5 GW [13].If the plant is a tokamak operating in pulsed mode,integrated energy storage is required to smooth the output and avoid large swings to and from the grid.With these caveats,however,fusion is relatively well-suited to replace existing thermal electricity generation such as coal or fission."}
{"text": "Plasmas are prone to many instabilities;these include all the sources of turbulence of a normal fluid plus those added by the electromagnetic properties of a conducting fluid. The mass of a fusion plasma is very small,typically no more than a few grams in a reactor,and the forces can be very large,meaning gross instabilities can grow very fast. These must be stabilized to prevent the plasma moving around and contacting the first wall of the reactor,cooling the plasma down and possibly damaging the wall.Many of these problems are understood:the remaining issues relate to developing radiation- hardened diagnostic systems which can monitor the plasma state and control systems capable of reacting in time to stabilize plasma movement.In addition,small instabilities, in the form of convection cells,increase energy transport in the plasma and allow it to cool down by carrying heat away from the core and into plasma-facing surfaces such as the divertor.If these energy loss channels are too rapid,heating the plasma to fusion conditions becomes very difficult.The best (magnetic)energy confinement regime available at the moment is called H-(high confinement)mode.Unfortunately this operating mode,characterized by a steep increase in pressure at the plasma edge,is prone to an instability called an edge-localized mode (ELM).ELMs regularly peel off chunks of high-energy plasma which are predicted to overwhelm the capabilities of the plasma-facing surfaces and identifying ways to eliminate these is one of the most pressing problems in tokamak research."}
{"text": "One of the most stressful environments for materials in a magnetically confined fusion reactor is the divertor,a structure designed to conduct away heat from the plasma once it has been conducted away from the plasma core to the edge.The divertor surface is directly exposed to the plasma and experiences the highest heat fluxes in the machine as well as a constant rain of high-energy particles,causing erosion of the surface.It is a component which must be replaced many times throughout the lifetime of the reactor. The design of the divertor system is both a technology problem in the choice of materials and engineering to handle the structural loads and conduct the heat away from the surface,and a physics problem as the shape of the plasma and the configuration of the magnetic field must be designed and controlled in a way which avoids excessively large loads falling onto the plasma-facing surface,even temporarily."}
{"text": "Most of the remainder of the inside of the reactor is covered by the breeder blanket,a structure with a number of functions.Firstly,it must capture the neutrons from fusion and turn them into new tritium fuel.The blanket contains a neutron multiplier such as beryllium or lead,which allows a single fusion-produced neutron to create more than one new tritium atom from comingled lithium-6-enriched breeder material.Secondly, in capturing these neutrons and the energy they contain (and more energy released by the neutron multiplication and tritium breeding reactions),the blanket collects heat which can be extracted through cooling systems and used to generate electricity.Finally, the blanket also shields the safety-critical structures such as the vacuum vessel behind it from neutron damage.A critical parameter of the whole blanket system is the tritium breeding ratio(TBR).This is the ratio,averaged across the whole machine,of new tritium created to the amount burned in the fusion plasma.If the TBR is below 1(plus a small amount to account for losses in systems and decay in storage),the reactor will eventually run out of fuel.If the TBR is only a little greater than 1,it will take a very long time to stockpile enough additional tritium to start up another reactor and the fusion contri- bution to electricity production will only grow very slowly.The blanket,like the divertor, is a replaceable component.However,the lifetime is generally limited by neutron damage to the structural materials,not consumption of the neutron multiplier of breeder materials,which must be separated and recycled."}

{"text": "the heating and current drive (HCD)systems and the power required to pump the pri- mary coolant through the in-vessel components.The conversion of thermal power to electrical energy is also limited by the temperatures achievable in the primary coolant,a function of the materials available for use inside the reactor."}
{"text": "This brief description of technology issues may appear daunting,but considerable progress is being made not only on individual engineering and physics issues,but in understanding how to integrate the systems together and what the genuinely promising design options are."}
{"text": "In magnetic confinement,the role of the magnetic field is to confine the plasma and hold it away from the reactor first wall,which provides protection to the structures behind it from direct radiation and particle loads.A toroidal geometry is required as this allows the magnetic field lines,along which the trapped particles travel,to wrap completely around the machine without cusps,which would enable rapid energy loss.Usually,in considering a power plant,steady state operation is targeted to allow continuous power output and reduce cyclic loads on components,but this is not a fundamental require- ment.The auxiliary systems which allow steady state operation of a tokamak,for example, consume large amounts of power and so reduce the overall plant efficiency."}
{"text": "The plasma in a spherical tokamak is shaped more like a cored apple than the \"classic\"doughnut shape,and the magnetic field varies much more across the plasma in such a machine than in a conventional tokamak.This leads to the potential for improved plasma physics,not least very high bootstrap current enabling easier steady state operation.However,the limited room on the inboard side of the plasma can make it hard to both shield the center column and magnets from neutron radiation,and capture enough neutrons to breed fuel."}
{"text": "A simple estimate of the size and requirements for performance of a magnetic confinement-based fusion power plant can be made.If the plasma-facing components can handle a maximum neutron flux of4 MWm-²,and a1GW(electrical)plant requires 3GW(fusion)to generate that output based on considerations of thermal efficiency and the power required to run plant systems [5],then that means the wall area of the reactor cannot be smaller than 600 m².For a conventional tokamak of aspect ratio A=3 and modest elongation(k=1.6),this means that the major radius Ro>6m.Similar ap- proaches applied to the plasma physics performance,divertor (plasma exhaust)power loading,etc.,tend to lead to slightly larger machines than this,usually with Ro about 8-9m [18].To achieve significant reductions in reactor size needs assumptions of ad- vances in available material performance or plasma performance which,while poten- tially possible in theory,are often not well experimentally demonstrated."}
{"text": "However,the fusion community must also try to get ahead of the game and identify early paths to reduce costs in a commercial plant.It is no good being able to say that the tenth-of-a-kind fusion power plant will meet the market's needs if you cannot sell the first of a kind.The involvement of industrial partners in ITER procurement and manu- facture,and in the EU-DEMO design is partly aimed at bringing commercial expertise and approaches into the fusion programme.The community is well aware of the need for fusion to be competitive with other energy sources and there is a lot of debate over the best ways to achieve this."}

This is intended to allow each partner to build up industry interest and support for fusion as well as acquiring the engineering and development skills required for future work in the area.ITER is supported by a satellite tokamak,JT-60SA,being built in Naka, Japan.JT-60SA is a superconducting tokamak intended to investigate how to optimize the operation of fusion power plants following ITER through the study of advanced modes of plasma operation.ITER should be operational by 2025,with burning(ther- monuclear D-T)plasmas by 2035 [34].A parallel materials programme based around ENS is also under development [35]."}

{"text": "Utilizing Eq.(26.4)suggests that approximately 5.8×10⁹t of CO₂is produced annually from its combustion.While this fossil fuel contributes 40%less carbon emissions annually than oil,it is important to note that it is also utilized 30%less than oil as shown in Fig.26.1 adapted from BP,Exon Mobile,and the EIA [17,21,22]."}
{"text": "Fig.26.1 shows how the tends in energy sources have changed over the last 50 or so years and will continue to change as advances are made in renewables,renewable storage,transport technologies,and transportation technologies along with changes in fossil fuel availability.In the future,this availability will adjust depending on extraction costs [17,21,22].What is interesting and relevant to point out is the prediction in future natural gas usage due to its availability,versatility,and perceived cleaner environmental footprint.There is also the prediction of an approximate 47%increase in renewable energy resources from 9%to 17%of the market by 2035 [17,21,22].While these changes look positive to the environment and the future,unfortunately,increases in population and prosperity mean that energy demands will far outpace the development and usage of renewables [17,21-23].Natural gas is seen as a cleaner alternative to oil and coal,but as the demands rise,there will be no relief to a reduction in the total carbon footprint in the foreseeable future."}
{"text": "It is worth mentioning in this section the potential perils to the environment that may result from a push to a hydrogen economy [24].Hydrogen (33.3 kWh kg-¹)has 61%more energy density on a kilowatt hour per kilogram basis than gasoline (12.9 kWh kg-¹). Unfortunately,it has been limited in application as an energy source due to its low volumetric storage density on a kilowatt hour per liter basis along with the ability to produce H₂as an energy carrier [25].Hydrogen gas stored at 69.9 MPa(10,000 psi)has a volumetric energy density of 1.26 kWh L-¹compared with gasoline at 9.2 kWh L- ¹ . Globally,H₂is almost entirely produced from fossil fuels and used as feedstock within the refining and chemical industries [26,27]."}
{"text": "The potential to replace internal combustion engines with fuel cells coupled with the future potential to generate H₂from renewables has led to considerable research focused on improving the volumetric and gravimetric storage density of H₂[27,28].Researchers estimate that more than 10%of all H₂currently produced leaks into the atmosphere during its production,storage,and transportation [24].Because H₂is so light,it can reach the stratosphere where it reacts with oxygen to form water leading to further destruction of the ozone layer [24].The long-term effects of increased H₂use on the environment need to be fully assessed before these technologies move forward."}
{"text": "26.4.1 History of methanol synthesis\n\nA quick look at the history of methanol synthesis is important to discuss as it has evolved and become a key intermediate and blending stock in the quest for production of syn- thetic liquid fuels.Today,global methanol demand is as high as 75×10⁶t(24 billion gallons)annually [40].There are more than 90 methanol plants that span the world from Asia,Africa,the Middle East,and Europe,to North and South America [40].Methanol is typically produced from syngas containing CO₂,and it is an essential feedstock for chemical manufacturing of formaldehyde,acetic acid,methyl tertiary butyl ether dimethyl ether (DME),and olefins [41].Methanol is also considered for H₂storage density of 49.5 mol (H₂)L-¹compared with supercritical H₂at a density of 15 mol(H₂) L-¹.Methanol as a H₂storage option has been limited in application by the inability to regenerate the methanol.Methanol is also a common solvent and considered an alter- native fuel and is used as a fuel blending stock for gasoline to improve the octane number despite the fact that it is contains approximately half the volumetric energy density of gasoline [41]."}
{"text": "Methanol chemistry was further revolutionized in the 1970s as a result of the Arab oil embargo against the United States in 1973 [43].This embargo led to national interest in alternative fuel sources.During this time,ExxonMobil scientists developed a highly se- lective process to convert methanol to gasoline(MTG)using a new class of shape- selective catalysts [43,44]."}
{"text": "The MTG process involves several steps where methanol is converted to a mixture of DME,water,and methanol [45].The mixture is dehydrated to olefins and water,and these olefins are oligomerized to higher olefins that are refined to gasoline.ZSM-5 limits the hydrocarbon synthesis reactions to Ci [44].The chemistries and processes have been the subject of many patents and reviews.In 1985,ExxonMobil first commercialized the pro- cess in New Zealand to produce 2300 m³per day (14,500 BPD)of gasoline [45].The process was operational until 1997 when the economics was no longer competitive with the price of crude oil at the time [45].Since then,ExxonMobil has licensed the technology to Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group JAMG)in China.In 2009,this group designed,built, and demonstrated the first,second generation MTG plant that produces 15,800 m³per day (2500 BPD)using coal as the syngas source in the Shanxi province of China.JAMG is currently constructing another plant with the plans to produce 2000 m³per day [45]. Further research advances by ExxonMobil are being taken to improve energy efficiencies and cost by changing from a fixed-bed reactor to a fluidized bed design [45]."}
{"text": "The FT process was well established in the 1970s,but it was not very selective for gasoline,and the products had to be extensively upgraded to achieve the octane needed for automotive use.Even today,the FT process produces a broad range of hydrocarbons that are refined to gasoline,jet fuel,and diesel,in contrast to the MTG process that uniquely produces gasoline from methanol."}
{"text": "26.4.2 Methanol synthesis from carbon dioxide\n\nBecause of the chemical versatility of methanol and the ability to produce methanol from non-fossil fuel resources such as biogas and municipal solid waste feedstocks [40], the late Dr.George A.Olah proposed\"The Methanol Economy\"[41,46].He reasoned that storing energy in the form of methanol could take advantage of the current liquid fossil fuel infrastructure and have the potential to use environmental CO₂as a primary feed- stock,thereby reducing an atmospheric gas that is believed to be the major contributor to global warming.A methanol-based economy as a replacement for fossil fuels could be economically advantageous over the hydrogen economy.The hydrogen economy would require significant economic investment in infrastructure and in the development of new methods and materials to store,handle,transport,and dispense the volatile gas [46,47].Not to mention hydrogen's volatility along with its corrosive nature that raises safety and environmental concerns as pointed out above,it is estimated that more than 10%of all H₂produced leaks into the atmosphere [24]."}
{"text": "While CO₂enhances the methanol synthesis processes from syngas,it can also serve as the primary feedstock as shown in Eq.(26.8)[31,41]."}
{"text": "CO₂+3H₂→CH₃OH+H₂O 4H₂98K=-49.5 kJ mol- ¹ (26.8)\n\nThe thermochemical synthesis of methanol directly from CO₂and H₂has been viewed by many as a key solution for mitigation of anthropogenic CO₂.However,the synthesis of methanol directly from CO₂and H₂still presents many challenges."}
{"text": "Thermodynamically,the synthesis shown in Eq.(26.8)competes with the endothermic reverse water gas shift (RWGS)reaction as given in Eq.(26.9)[31,41]."}
{"text": "CO₂+H₂≥CO+H₂O4rH₂98K=+41.2 kJ mol- ¹ (26.9)\n\nActivating CO₂requires raising the temperature but at the risk of enhancing the RWGS reaction pathway and producing undesirable products such as other alcohols, hydrocarbons,and CO and thus decreasing the methanol selectivity."}
{"text": "The world's first commercial methanol plant that uses CO₂as its primary carbon feedstock was built in Iceland by Carbon Recycling International(CRI)in 2012 [48].The plant has a capacity to produce 5×10⁶La-¹,where a refers to annum of methanol and recycles 5.5×10³t of CO₂.Because the process is uniquely situated near the Svartsengi power station,the power station provides a source of CO₂from its geothermal steam emissions and renewable electricity that is used to produce H₂from water electrolysis and energy for the entire CRI process.The Svartsengi power station is the world's first geothermal power plant,and it produces 75MW of electrical energy and 150 MW of thermal energy for district heating.The ability to capitalize on the current renewable geothermal infrastructures to produce CO₂-free H₂allows the CRI methanol process to be economically and environmentally feasible."}
{"text": "CRI uses conventional Cu-and ZnO-based catalysts used in the synthesis of methanol from syngas for hydrogenation of CO₂to methanol.CO₂conversion and methanol selectivity range from 3.3%conversion and 100%selectivity to 30%CO₂conversion and 90%selective for methanol depending on the support and additional oxides comprising the catalyst as provided by Porosoff et al.,Saeidi et al.,and Wang et al.[32,35,37].Recent reports suggest In₂O₂/ZrCO₂and ZnO-ZrO₂solid solution catalysts to be promising candidates for methanol synthesis [35].While research and progress continues,many researchers in the field agree that the reaction mechanism for CO₂hydrogenation to methanol remains elusive [32,35]."}
{"text": "26.5 Olefin synthesis from carbon dioxide\n\nWhile the synthesis of methanol from CO₂and H₂has been demonstrated commercially, the synthesis of light olefin intermediates has been extensively studied and demon- strated at the laboratory scale [32,37].Light olefin intermediates serve as key building blocks in the chemical industry and can easily be oligomerized to a liquid fuel fraction by acid-catalyzed oligomerization involving zeolitic materials,solid phosphoric acid,acid resins,and amorphous silica-alumina.Similarly,metal-catalyzed oligomerization of light olefins occurs using aluminum,nickel,titanium,zirconium,hafnium,vanadium, tantalum,cobalt,and iron-based catalysts [47,49]."}
{"text": "The RWGS is in equilibrium with the WGS reaction and Le Chatelier's principle in- dicates the endothermic reaction is thermodynamically favored by higher temperatures and increasing the H₂/CO₂ratio [33,51].The forward reaction (WGS)and the catalyst systems used to promote this reaction have been examined in much more depth as the reaction is industrially used in conjunction with steam reforming of methane,coal,or biomass to produce pure H₂[52]."}
{"text": "There is still much deliberation regarding the RWGs reaction mechanism [33,34]."}
{"text": "There are two primary reaction mechanisms considered,the redox mechanism and the formate mechanism [33,34].The redox mechanism involves the decomposition of CO₂to CO and atomic oxygen followed by the atomic oxygen hydrated to water.H₂is proposed to be a reducing reagent without direct participation in the formation of intermediates in the reaction [31].The formate mechanism consists of the dissociation of H₂on the metal sites and the hydrogenation of CO₂into formate.CO is formed by the cleavage of the C= O bond from the formate intermediate [37].Research evidence indicates that the mechanism is strongly dependent on the reaction conditions(temperature)and catalyst composition.The observations made of different species produced under different re- action conditions suggest that WGS and RWGS mechanisms could be different [30]."}
{"text": "the addition of K keeps Mo in a more reduced and active state as evidence by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements.Both experimental and theoretical studies suggest that K promotes the increase in CO₂binding energy and CO₂bond dissociation to the formation of CO,as a result,CO₂conversion reaches as high as 18%with a selectivity for CO as high as 96%[62]."}
{"text": "Sunfire in collaboration with Nordic Blue Crude,Climeworks,EDL Anlagenbau,and partners is planning to build the first commercial plant for the production of Blue Crude (synthetic diesel made from CO₂)in Heroya,Norway [63].A three-step approach will produce 10×10⁶L a-¹(10 million liters per year)starting in 2020.Blue Crude will be produced using renewable electricity from hydropower to operate a steam electrolysis process (SOEC)that generates CO₂-free H₂and oxygen.The H₂is combined with CO₂ captured from air to produce CO,and from these products,Blue Crude is synthesized."}
{"text": "Keith et al.recently published their evaluation of Carbon Engineering's(CE)pilot plant CO₂DAC process [66].The DAC process differs from the Climeworks'process in that it uses aqueous basic solutions of KOH as the capture media.They cite several advantages of using aqueous sorbents over solid sorbents materials including solution surface renewal and the invulnerability to dust and atmospheric contaminants on the solution's capture capacity.The DAC process involves two connected chemical loops that involve four steps.In the first loop, Step-1,atmospheric air is contacted with a potassium hydroxide (KOH)solution,and the atmospheric CO₂reacts with the KOH to form calcium carbonate(K₂CO₃);in a second loop, Step-2, the K₂CO₃is reacted with calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)₂to form KOH and CaCO₃precipitate.The KOH is fed back into the first loop to replenish the sorbent stream.The CaCO₃subsequently is calcined in Step-3 to liberate CO₂producing CaO that is hydrated to produce Ca(OH)2 in Step-4. The Ca(OH) is fed back to the first loop to react with the K₂CO₃.The full-scale CE process was designed to capture~1×10⁶t of CO₂per year.The CE pilot plant captures 1t of CO₂each day.The pilot plant costs are $600 per tonne of CO₂,similar to Climeworks process discussed above.CE claims that a full-scale plant will reduce costs to scale $94 to$232 per tonne of CO₂.CE continues to operate and validate the prototype process for commercial validation as it looks to the future for broad commercial deployment in 2021."}
{"text": "Climeworks'and CE's DAC technologies are profoundly different;however,both companies have demonstrated significant engineering advancements and achieved design and operational costs that suggest a promising commercial future for the utili- zation of these technologies.From a strategic operational fuel perspective,these pro- cesses will be limited by their footprint and need to be in an open and unobstructed environmental scenario.In efforts to reduce the technological footprint and the need for unobstructed large spaces,and to take advantage of a more concentrated environmental source of carbon,the USNaval Research Laboratory has patented an electrochemical process that captures CO₂from seawater and simultaneously produces H₂as a feedstock source for operational fuel production [64]."}
{"text": "The NRL electrolytic cation exchange module (E-CEM)process uses current to manipulate the complex seawater buffer system by reequilibrating all the bicarbonate and carbonate in the seawater to carbonic acid [67].The CO₂from the carbonic acid is vacuum/membrane stripped.Simultaneously,the process produces equal molar quan- tities of H₂,and the amount of H₂produced is proportional to the applied electrical current that follows Faraday's law.NRL has successfully scaled and demonstrated \"proof of concept\"in an operationally relevant environment.The information gathered from the evaluations was used to design and construct a commercial prototype E-CEM.The E- CEM will be capable of producing more than enough CO₂and H₂to synthesize a gallon of operational fuel a day.The target energy consumption for the module is aligned to the H₂production,4.3 kWh m-³.The evaluation at these process scales will lead to further improvements in design and energy efficiencies,along with the capability to integrate fuel-producing capabilities."}
{"text": "Capturing CO₂from the air is based on the volume of air that must be processed."}
{"text": "Lower concentrations of CO₂per unit volume of air from the atmosphere means more volume of gas must be treated compared with CO₂captured from concentrated indus- trial sources and that bound in the ocean as carbonate and bicarbonate.This translates into larger CO₂processing plants and higher energy consumption.It is estimated that roughly 45,000 m³per day of CO₂is needed to produce 37,850L(10,000 gallons)of operational fuel per day.For the purposes of discussion,the Climeworks'largest process produces 2485m³per day of CO₂and requires 180 m²of space.From a strategic fuel perspective,roughly 18 units would be needed,which would require 3240 m²for its footprint and a large enough unobstructed space to flow air.The current E-CEM tech- nology is estimated to require 12,000 m³of space for the same fuel quantity,and current estimates suggest the process can easily be incorporated into platforms to produce strategic fuel in areas of operation."}

{"text": "Everyday activities rely on a mix of mechanical,thermal,chemical,acoustic,and nuclear energy.Most of the Earth's available energy comes from the Sun.The fusion and fission of the Sun emits large amounts of electromagnetic radiation,which bombards Earth.This incoming solar radiation includes light at all spectra.Plants use and store this energy at visible light wavelengths,i.e.,photosynthesis.Animals use the stored energy for respiration.The remains of these plants and animals are deposited and,under pressure and over vast periods of time,captured in minerals,known as fossil fuels."}
{"text": "The Sun is also the source of many so-called alternative energy sources.Most obvious is solar energy,where the electromagnetic energy is used directly(e.g.,to heat water)or indirectly,in photovoltaic systems that convert photons to electrons.Wind is actually a type of solar energy,as the heating of the atmosphere leads to air movements.Bioenergy systems,e.g.,algae and wood,are also solar,given that they derive their energy from photosynthesis and respiration."}

{"text": "Choosing the best energy source is complicated.Advocates for and against various sources invoke criteria for what is\"best.\"Some argue for reliability of production. Others emphasize economics,e.g.,based on a cost-benefit analysis.Arguably,however, the most contentious and important are the public health and environmental impacts of the various energy sources.Unfortunately,comparisons are often difficult given the differences in the steps needed to provide energy to the end user.For example,an electric car may appear to be much cleaner than a gasoline-powered car,based solely on tailpipe emissions.The comparison becomes more complicated,when the major source of electricity is coal,which,when burned,emits large amounts of pollution from a stationary source,i.e.,the power plant.Next,the impacts from the extraction (coal mine vs.oil well),transport (rail vs.pipeline),etc.,need to be considered in any proper decision."}
{"text": "Thus,the best way to consider the impacts of energy production,distribution,and transport is to employ a life-cycle analysis (LCA).Such analyses are only as good as the assumptions and data used.It is important to keep in mind that energy use is similar to all societal decisions in that it depends on what is valued."}
{"text": "The value placed on an activity or material determines the costs that will be tolerated."}
{"text": "For much of the past century in the United States,for example,much of society considered personal transportation based on the internal combustion engine to be highly valued,even if that has meant urban smog and other environmental impacts.If there is a switch to substantially greater numbers of electric vehicles,this may entail a change to less mobile sources of pollution,but greater centralized,stationary sources from fossil fuel-fired and nuclear power-generating stations."}
{"text": "Whether such a transition is better depends on what is valued.In almost every large- scale energy plan,it is not a question of one option with much pollution and the other with no pollution.It is often a matter of type of pollutant.In our electricity versus in- ternal combustion example,the electric car system would emit large amounts of par- ticulate matter (PM),sulfur dioxide (SO₂),nitrogen dioxide (NO₂),and heavy metals (including mercury [Hgl)from a central source.Conversely,each gasoline-powered car would emit much smaller amounts of PM,volatile organic compounds (VOCs),such as benzene,and other pollutants,but the overall emission from millions of small mobile sources (vehicles)is what is important.Society may be willing to accept increased rates of diseases,even mortalities,as well as damage to ecosystems,if they place a higher value of internal combustion engines than less polluting options.Such trade-offs are common.LCA is a tool for presenting the differences,but energy decisions depend on the willingness to make trade-offs.Incidentally,the status quo is difficult to change,even when facts show it to be less efficient and more costly than a new approach [1]."}
{"text": "Certainly,all environmental decisions are technical in content,but they vary in the mix of skills and content needed.For example,both structural and mechanical engi- neers address the laws of motion and thermodynamics but differ as to why.Mechanical engineers may be more interested in finding better ways to make something move, whereas structural engineers are more likely to make sure something never moves over its designed life or at least moves in nanometers rather than meters.Even this distinction is variable,as a mechanical engineer working on a braking system may share more in common with the structural engineer than his mechanical engineering colleagues working on increasing an engine's torque and delivering more energy to turn the wheels.Often,however,the distinctions lie with the mix of physics,chemistry, and biology."}
{"text": "When considering the first canon of the engineering profession,i.e.,to “hold para- mount the safety,health,and welfare of the public”[2],the public is often perceived to be a broad and amorphic entity.However,as engineering must always incorporate sufficient margins of safety,good design must include the needs of persons who his- torically have been underrepresented.Unfortunately,the opposite has been the case all too often in the past.The path of least resistance to gain approval for infrastructures has often gone right through the neighborhoods of disadvantaged neighborhoods.Entire communities have been displaced,historical treasures lost,and sacred land trampled as engineers and planners found far less resistance from these neighborhoods than from those with higher socioeconomic status (SES).Zoning to pave the way for the factory, shopping center,and other private endeavors,siting the power plant and other quasi- public projects,and selecting the best place for a landfill,wastewater treatment plant, highway,or other public infrastructural enterprises have been much easier to attain in neighborhoods with muted voices."}
{"text": "27.3 Upstream component\n\nEvery energy source has upstream impacts.That is,all materials that need to be extracted from the Earth to provide the energy from a system must be considered. Obviously,coal and uranium must be mined,crude oil and natural gas drilled,and trees harvested.However,this also extends to\"nonemitting\"sources.Solar panels must be constructed of materials extracted from Earth (e.g.,silica and crude oil to make plastics). Wind turbines are made of steel and other metals that require extracting ores,as well as other manufactured materials(e.g.,plastic insulation)."}
{"text": "After extraction,the next upstream LCA stage includes the manufacturing processes that are needed for all types of energy production and transport but differ among the energy sources.Manufactured products are needed for decentralized systems,such as solar panels and wind turbines installed on buildings,as well as large,stationary sources,such as the construction of a coal or nuclear power-generating facility.The footprint of these large systems can be extensive in terms of time,materials,and energy demands."}
{"text": "The principal upstream stressors result from mining and drilling.Mining changes habitats physically,chemically,and biologically.Physically removing large amounts of overburden completely changes the geomorphology of the mining region.This involves the removal of the soil and rocks and has caused environmental problems and some- times loss of life.Surface mining comes in many forms."}
{"text": "27.3.2 Mining stressors\n\nMining a seam of mineral ore by first removing a long strip of overburden is called strip mining and is often used in coal mining.It is also being used to extract the tar and oil from the sand at Athabasca in Alberta,resulting in severe damage to the ecology and posing a threat to Alberta's boreal forest ecosystem.Open pit mining refers to mining from a huge open pit,which can be very deep and large.This approach has been used to mine lignite in Germany and coal in Colombia [3,4] ."}
{"text": "change is due altered hydrology of rivers and streams,as well as the creation of barriers to migration and loss of interconnections within and between habitats and ecotones.

{"text": "Other impacts of surface mines include esthetics,groundwater and surface water runoff contamination,noise,air quality(dust and mining pollutants),vibration,subsi- dence,and a devastating effect on the flora and fauna of the region [3,5]."}
{"text": "In addition to habitat destruction,mining activities lead to explosions,subsidence, slurry spills,and chemical pollution both aboveground and through groundwater.The chemical pollution results when soil and rock are broken,allowing migration of metals and other elements from the mining area in air(i.e.,fugitive dust)and in water.One of the most common results from surface coal mines is an increase in acidity."}
{"text": "By the mid-1960s,a century of US surface mining had disturbed over 8000 km², including 21,000 km of streams(totaling 550 km²),281 natural lakes (419 km²),and 168 reservoirs (168 km²).During this time,coal mining accounted for 41%of the total disturbed lands,the bulk of pollution being from acid mine drainage in the East and the Midwest portions of the United States.Current US surface mining regulations mandate the restoration of disturbed lands [6]."}
{"text": "Areas with underlying crystalline rock,shale,and sandstone are more prone to acidification than those underlain by rock systems that buffer the acids,e.g.,limestone and other carbonate-rich rock.Potentially sensitive areas are widely distributed in North America and include much of the Appalachian Mountains,where rainfall is most acidic (Fig.27.5);the Canadian Shield region of the Upper Midwest (that is,the northern parts of Michigan and Wisconsin,as well as eastern Minnesota and parts of eastern and central Canada);the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada,Rocky Mountains,and Cascade Range;and parts of the Ozark and Ouachita uplands,mid-Atlantic coastal plain, and Florida.Buffering by ions in groundwater and constituents leached from watersheds makes large lakes and rivers at lower elevations less susceptible to acidification than smaller,high-elevation lakes and streams."}

{"text": "Acid mine drainage mainly occurs from coal mining,whereas acid rain is predomi- nantly caused by combustion of the mined coal.When the power plant is located near the mine,the two problems are exacerbated.From a chemical perspective,rain is acidic if its pH is less than seven;however,acid rain is commonly considered to have a pH lower than about 5.0.Indeed,the pH of distilled water in equilibrium with atmospheric CO₂is 5.6,but other atmospheric constituents tend to make rainfall more acidic."}

When concentrated and made bioavailable to humans and other organisms,such as from extraction and refining processes,they present major threats to public health and the environment."}

{"text": "Underground or shaft coal mining also has environmental risks,including ground- water contamination,subsidence,and coal fires.A coal mine fire smolders,as oxygen levels are low,meaning they can burn for many years.This presents a serious problem from many aspects:economical (burning a vital commodity);environmental (emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases—CH₄and CO₂and mercury);dangerous subsidence; and toxic."}

{"text": "Internationally,there are probably many hundreds of coal fires presently burning in Australia,Canada,China,Germany,India,Indonesia,New Zealand,Norway,South Africa,the United States,and other countries,which are the source of least 3%of the world's annual emissions.For example,fires from China's coal mines presently release about 1×10⁹t(billion metric tonnes,t)of CO₂to the atmosphere every year.Estimates put India's coal mine fire releases to be about 50×10⁶t.This accounts for as much as 1%of all carbon greenhouse gas releases.This is about the same as the CO₂released by all of the gasoline fuel automobiles in the United States.Engineering solutions that reduce these emissions would actively improve the net greenhouse gas global flux.Some US coal mine fires have burned for more than a century."}

Both are aromatic in that they have a 6-carbon ring.Benzene is carcinogenic and neurotoxic.Toluene is also neurotoxic and causes reproductive disorders.VOCs from drilling operations include numerous other aromatic(carbon ring structure)and aliphatic (carbon chain structure),which have health effects.They also contribute to smog(tropospheric ozone).Operations that produce these compounds include venting, flaring,and dehydration of natural gas [9].Other drilling-related air pollutants include carbon monoxide,oxides of nitrogen,ozone,and sulfur dioxide,which are products of incomplete combustion (PICs)(e.g.,flaring).Methane and hydrogen sulfide occur naturally with and in the aquifers and are released during the drilling process."}
{"text": "Soil can be contaminated by hydrocarbons in the crude oil and any impurities, including heavy metals,salts,and radioactive isotopes,as well as chemicals used in the development process,e.g.,2-butoxyethanol,2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol,and non- ylphenol.All three have been linked to endocrine disruption,among other health effects in humans [10]."}
{"text": "Drilling operations pollute both ground and surface waters.Groundwater is polluted when the oil or gas enters aquifers,especially drinking water aquifers,from leaks in casings and other means of penetration,such as cracks in confining strata,allowing the oil,gas,and their impurities to enter other strata (See Fig.27.11)."}

{"text": "The window for safe drilling between the fracture gradient and the pore pressure gradient decreases with drilling depth,so keeping the correct amount of equivalent circulating density had become increasingly difficult.This perturbed the integrity of the well and led to fluid losses.As this safety window narrowed,BP began to change plans by reducing the well's target depth,considering changes in well casings,reducing the circulating rate below the parameters specified to convert the float collar,decreasing the density of cement with nitrogen foam,using less cement,and ceasing to conduct complete bottoms-up cementing."}
{"text": "A negative pressure test was taken to make certain that the cement would stop flowing from the oil reservoir into the well after seawater replaced the drilling mud.The test should have been a red flag of trouble ahead,that is,the pressure readings on the drill pipe were abnormal.This should have been a warning that the cement barrier was not working.Pressure bypassed the cement and float equipment,so that the well was still connected to the oil formation.At the very least,this was a miscalculation,as the negative pressure test results were misinterpreted.The failure was compounded when BP decided to go ahead with the final displacement."}
{"text": "The BP oil spill flowed into the Gulf for 3 months and is the largest oil spill disaster in the history of the oil industry.The explosion on the rig killed 11 men and injured 17. The oil poured out of a leak on the seafloor bottom.It released 780,000 m³(4.9 million barrels)of oil into the Gulf of Mexico;about 800 km (500 miles)off the coastline of Louisiana,Mississippi,Florida,and Alabama was contaminated by BP oil.The spill affected every type of flora and fauna in the area,whales and dolphins died at twice their normal rate,wetland grass and flora died and fishing came to a halt,and an underwater plume,not visible on the surface,killed seafloor flora and fauna;BP admitted that it made mistakes and soon after the accident set up a $20 billion fund to compensate victims of the oil spill [13]."}
{"text": "This disaster demonstrates the risks of deepwater drilling,which is inherently risky but is exacerbated when human error is associated with dependence on technologies for monitoring and early warning,stabilization,and navigation.It is quite difficult to quantify these risks for comparisons to other energy options,e.g.,the mining options discussed earlier.In addition,applying these comparisons to societal trade-offs may not lend itself to quantification.For example,cycling is virtually free of fossil fuels,but the demand for individual and personal transportation may outweigh concerns for the environment.The LCA can only present such alternatives."}
{"text": "The determination of disproportionate impacts,i.e.,diseases and other health end points are fundamental to environmental justice.Epidemiologists look at clusters and other indications of elevated exposures and effects in populations.Certain cancers, neurological,and other chronic diseases have been found to be significantly higher in minority communities and in socioeconomically depressed areas.Acute diseases,as indicated by hospital admissions,may also be higher in certain segments of society,such as pesticide poisoning in migrant workers.In addition,each person responds to an environmental insult uniquely and that person is affected differently at various life stages.For example,young children are at higher risk to neurotoxins.However,sub- populations also can experience different effects than that of the whole population, meaning that genetic differences seem to affect people's susceptibility to contaminant exposure.Scientists are very interested in genetic variation,so that genomic techniques [16],e.g.,identifying certain polymorphisms,are a growing area of inquiry [17] ."}
{"text": "It appears that the tribes have borne disproportionate exposure to pollution and destruction of environmental resources.The disproportionate exposure demonstrates the weakness of the benefit to cost ratio (B/C),which is often considered for large populations,akin to the statistical concept of a normal distribution (Fig.27.13). Assuming that the benefits and costs in a given situation are normally distributed within a population,the option with the average,largest benefits versus costs would be selected."}
{"text": "Incidentally,costs can include values that are difficult or impossible to monetize.For instance,cost must include the health and ecological risks when constructing a benefit/ cost relationship.However,these are often insufficiently monetized using economic concepts such as willingness to pay,the value of life year,and cost of illness [18]. Dependence of monetizability is an inherent weakness of the B/C,which often assumes that any cost or benefit is quantifiable.Furthermore,economic analysis often is inap- propriately applied to ecosystems.For example,the so-called“environmental services” of an ecosystem are only a part of its value [19].This is often limited to those services valued by large segments of the population and is very anthropocentric,i.e.,what good does this ecosystem provide to humans?The distinction is often between instrumental versus inherent value,with many ecosystem service advocates most interested in the former."}
{"text": "In the case of tribal lands,the normal distribution can lead to environmental in- justices;it has placed a disproportionate environmental and potential health burden on the tribes.This may also demonstrate a type of\"tyranny of the majority.Often,the curve is not normally distributed but is skewed in favor of the higher socioeconomic strata(Fig.27.14).As is often the case,the energy extraction disparity is doubly unfair,in that many people assuming most of the costs and risks have received the fewest benefits and have had little voice in the decisions as to how and where to extract the minerals."}
{"text": "27.4 Fuel cycle stage\n\nSome fuels are useable directly as extracted,e.g.,natural gas and coal,but often need to be changed physically to aid transport and combustion.For example,the natural gas may be compressed for ease in cross-oceanic transport.Coal will be crushed and even pul- verized,depending on the combustion requirements.Other materials require processing and conversion.Processing uranium ore into useable fuel may require large amounts of energy,often from fossil fuels.Thus,even though the nuclear reactions themselves produce no greenhouse gases or other pollutants,the processing steps certainly will."}
{"text": "Crude oil processing and conversion is a substantial source of environmental pollution.Depending on the end product,varying amounts of energy is needed to refine crude oil into gasoline,diesel fuel,kerosene,etc.In addition,the life cycle must also consider the other needs of the final product.For example,both electric and\n\n'The phrase was coined by Alexis de Tocqueville and considered at some length by John Stuart Mills."}

{"text": "Another aspect of the fuel cycle is the transport of the raw material to the various sites.In its gaseous form,natural gas is transported by pipelines.The excavation,con- struction,and upkeep of these lines must be considered as part of natural gas life cycle. Indeed,pipelines can have major environmental impacts on ecosystems,such as bifurcating or truncating habitats,changing migration patterns,interfering with spawning and nesting,and even changing micrometeorology (e.g.,warm pipelines changing caribou migration).Pipelines also present human safety and health risks from explosion and fire,as methane(CH₄)and other alkanes are highly explosive and flam- mable.As mentioned,natural gas may also be compressed and shipped as a liquid in tankers.Although they do not have the risk of oil spills,such long-range shipments require energy and potential threats to ecosystems,e.g.,bilge issues."}
{"text": "27.4.1 Fuel cycle stressors\n\nEnvironmental stressors introduced in the fuel cycle stages include many of those mentioned for upstream stages,as the extracted ores and substances are what are being transported and processed.Because crude oil presents very large environmental threats during transport,it is discussed in detail,followed by a discussion of raw material processing."}
{"text": "27.4.2 Crude oil transport stressors\n\nCrude oil is also transported via pipelines,with the same risks as above.In addition, when crude oil is leaked,it can have devastating impacts on ecosystems,both terrestrial and aquatic.Transport by tanker and barge presents substantial environmental threats."}
{"text": "The extent and duration of a leak or spill is determined by the available volume of a substance.Once the ship hull or tank is emptied,the spill itself ends,but the damage it causes can endure for decades.If the source is vast,such as the oil in rock strata under the Gulf of Mexico,the spill will end only after the pressure differential between the strata and the surface reaches equilibrium or until the available substance is depleted.Thus,the properties of the fluid and the charac- teristics of the environment determine the amount and rate of a contaminant that is released in a disaster [12]."}
{"text": "at in 35th position in terms of weight (37,000 t).This illustrates that the amount spilled is only part of the criteria used to determine disaster status of an event.In the case of the Valdez,much of the problem had to do with where the spill occurred and the sensitivity of the habitat.Some organisms readily adapt to change,whereas as other more sensitive organisms may be irreversibly affected by very slight changes in habitat conditions."}

{"text": "27.4.3 Refining-related stressors\n\nAfter extraction,the large source of pollution in terms of total mass released to the environment occurs during processing of the raw materials.For example,petroleum refining releases PM(0.1-3 kgt-¹of crude),oxides of sulfur (0.2-0.6 kg t-¹of crude), oxides of nitrogen (0.06-0.5 kgt-¹of crude)and VOCs(e.g.,2.5g of benzene,toluene and xylene in 1t of crude).Refining also uses massive amounts of water (producing up to 5m³of wastewater for every 1t of crude refined,even when recycling the water).When released to waterways,this waste can significantly lower dissolved oxygen (averaging 150 mg L-¹biochemical oxygen demand),presenting a large threat to aquatic life [21]."}

{"text": "27.5.2 Operation\n\nOperation is often the only or principal consideration when comparing environmental impacts of energy choices.For example,a vehicle's tailpipe emissions and fuel econo- mies are compared with those of other vehicles.Indeed,these are important consider- ations,but,as the previous discussion have shown,are only part of the life cycle.Today, for instance,most electric cars are actually“coal-fired\"or \"nuclear-powered”vehicles. This will continue until alternative energy sources supplant fossil fuel and nuclear sources of electricity."}
{"text": "The same goes for home and other building heating and cooling.Units have improved their energy efficiencies dramatically in recent decades."}
{"text": "Also,choices of materials can greatly affect downstream impacts.For example, chemicals injected underground are among the controversial aspects of hydraulic fracturing to obtain natural gas and other fossil fuels from previously unproductive strata.If safer,biodegradable chemicals are used,at least one concern would be less- ened,i.e.,potential contamination of water supplies.And,the problems of decom- missioning fracture sites would be ameliorated if no toxic substances have been used during the useful life of the project.Conversely,if recalcitrant and toxic substances are used,these would have to be removed and treated during and after the project."}
{"text": "Automobile manufacturers are increasingly being called on to design vehicles so that nothing from that vehicle finds its way to the landfill.All materials must be used up, recycled,or reused.Developing nations that are increasingly extracting,refining,and processing ores and crude must consider the problems of developed nations only a few decades ago.Many energy activities were shortsighted,extracting and processing as much as possible,believing they would simply move on to other sites.However,aban- doned and active hazardous wastes sites became more widespread and more difficult to cleanup.Many energy companies,if they had a chance to do it over,would likely not repeat these mistakes,given the lawsuits,public health issues,and costs in the billions of dollars,not to mention the wrath of shareholders.The costs go beyond eco- nomic and financial but can include irreparable political,legal,and environmental damage.In this sense,sustainability is extended from the environment and public health to corporate and personal reputations.It is better to prevent these problems than to try to repair them."}

{"text": "28.1 Introduction\n\nThis chapter will look at the future of energy from a“Built Environment”demand side, that is,the user's perspective and in particular it will consider the under played role of \"heat.\"We take the United Kingdom as an example of how change may occur and the forces at work which will influence this."}
{"text": "The result of this slightly one-sided discussion being that decarbonization of the Built Environment is not currently on target to meet its goals [2].The United Kingdom has a legally binding target to reduce carbon emissions 80%below 1990 levels by 2050. According to the 2019,guidance issued by the Committee on Climate Change(CCC),this cannot be done without a near complete decarbonization of the entire heating sector. The UK government has called heat our greatest technical and policy challenge in meeting our carbon targets."}
{"text": "28.2 The existing stock of buildings and their energy use\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon future\"Built Environment\"must begin with the status quo and the total decarbonization of our existing housing stock is a huge ask.Globally the\"Built Environment\"covers cities with huge population densities,there are already 19 existing \"mega cities\"in the world each with populations over 10 million.London is soon to be one,while there are also millions of small towns and villages with populations in the thousands,then innumerable hamlets of a few homes each.All buildings use and receive energy in various forms,electricity,gas,oil or solid fuel.Much of this use is domestic,in our homes,the remaining,nonindustrial uses,being in our workplaces and communities.All these differing types of buildings and communities will require bespoke approaches to the problem."}
{"text": "Over the last 15 years,there has been a growing awareness within the property and construction sectors that we had a looming issue,and in 2008,the UK Green Building Council was formed to bring together forward thinking industry players,academia,and institutions and give the government a route to communicate with the industry as a whole.Fig.28.1 was produced at this point in time to emphasize that the major unad- dressed issue that faces us in the United Kingdom is our energy use in domestic property or to be clear—our homes,the large purple section of Fig.28.1.The United Kingdom has been called“the paradigm case for the developed world”[3].To illustrate the scale of the challenge,a typical project S curve from the formation of the UKGBC in 2008 through to 2050 was introduced to show the scale of the challenge to reduce carbon by 80%,but the truth is it now out of date and should be going to zero in 2050."}
{"text": "28.3 Energy use in buildings and attempts to reduce it\n\nWhy we use energy in our buildings is very consistent.We use it to maintain comfort,to clean,to preserve and prepare food,to provide light,and now more than ever for digital devices."}
{"text": "But these uses can usefully be divided further between those that use an energy source such as burning gas to deliberately change temperature and those that generate heat as a by-product secondary to their main purpose.Obviously maintaining comfort is about staying warm enough or indeed cool enough (heating and cooling are both \"heat\" energy,just at slightly different temperatures),cleaning is heating water,food preserving is cooling and food preparation heating."}
{"text": "But separate from these deliberate heat generation processes,we have the waste heat generators,these are all about electricity.Power stations using carbon fuels are only 30%-40%efficient at producing electricity,most of what they produce is waste heat; then this electricity is used to power artificial lighting,digital devices,and data centers all of which largely convert this electricity to heat energy.A key part of future energy management will be the capturing and reuse of all this\"waste heat.\"To be fair,some sectors have made great progress in efficiency lighting has lead a transformation over 20 years moving tungsten bulbs,15 Im W-¹(15 lumen per watt),to digital LEDs at 100 Im W-¹a dramatic increase in efficiency and one that is helping to enable expansion of Photo Voltaic microgrids distributed energy as the new energy solution of choice in the developing world."}
{"text": "It is perhaps worth here ensuring we understand what we mean by\"heat.\"From an engineering viewpoint heat energy involves a change in temperature.Whether this is from 1-20℃ or 201-220℃,it is the same quantity of heat energy.From a human perspective obviously some heat is cold and some is hot and thus we in the Built Environment refer to the \"grade\"of heat as a way to consider its usefulness.That which we utilize in buildings to \"heat\"in radiator and underfloor heating systems is commonly described as low grade heat (between 30-d 90℃),meanwhile we\"cool\"utilizing tem- peratures between around 10 and-20℃ depending whether you are cooling an office or a cold store.High-grade heat is what you get when you burn something.The higher the grade the more useful and hence valuable it is."}
{"text": "Currently there are two grids in the United Kingdom that distribute energy-—the gas grid and the electricity grid.We in the United Kingdom have a well-developed gas grid supplying fuel in the form of natural gas which deals with most of our heating and an equally developed but much smaller,perhaps a quarter the capacity,electricity grid based around centralized power generation.Currently around 80%of UKheat demand is met with natural gas fired boilers.In this present system,gas is both the energy distri- bution vector and the energy storage medium,releasing its stored energy as heat when it is burned.However,in an energy future where heat demand must be met without burning natural gas,there will still be a considerable amount of storage,shifting,and sharing required (Fig.28.2)."}
{"text": "All countries face similar issues but all with different starting points.Some have long had natural gas,some have not,some still rely on coal,some atomic energy,and hydro. The important point is—no country to date has a precedent case for transitioning away from an existing energy infrastructure system to a new one at this scale.Although some such as Denmark begin to show the way."}
{"text": "In the United Kingdom,little attempt was made to control the energy use of buildings until well into the 1970s.In an effort to reduce energy demand requirement to insulate homes have been gradually introduced into the building regulations for new properties followed by air tightness requirements to eliminate drafts optimum standards were reached around 2013."}
{"text": "The way energy is used in homes has shifted significantly over the last 20 years and particularly in the last 10.Heating,in new build apartments,is now the minority energy use.A situation which the majority of the UK population can still barely conceive as they shiver in their old homes but one which no doubt will become an issue as a growing percentage of the population benefit from insulation."}
{"text": "At the same time,we have had a significant change in electrical use with the growth of digital and mobile devices.The shift within homes to increased electricity use and reduction in gas looks set to continue with the introduction of legislation to eliminate new gas connections to homes by 2025 being announced in the spring statement by the UK chancellor in 2019.Meanwhile,the electricity grid continues to decarbonize and takes more and more renewables,and at the end of the\"feed-in tariff\"in the United Kingdom 2019,we now have around a million homes with PV.The government is actively exploring what comes after the feed-in tariff potentially it will be replaced with a requirement for fair rates for the sale of electricity to the grid by individuals.This together the appearance of digital facilities for peer-to-peer energy trading and aggre- gators who can help consumers act jointly to benefit from grid balancing services is allowing the consumer to begin to play a significant role in energy supply.This is the growth of so-called\"prosumers\"who have both PV generation on their homes and energy storage within them in the form of both batteries and thermal storage and being tech savvy enough to find ways to engage in energy supply.The next section discusses the potential impact of these new market players."}
{"text": "28.5 Distributed energy and its impact on demand\n\nThe term“balance”has a specific significance for energy use.Electricity,once entered in the grid must be consumed.There is no return trip.Given that we have a centrally designed system,electricity flows from power plants through cables to end users.It is a \"dumb\"system in the sense that there is little communication between devices.An educated guess is made about the level of demand,and supply is created to match.This is challenging enough when supply can be increased simply by burning more fossil fuels, but as these baseloads are replaced with more intermittent renewables,the “balancing act\"becomes far more complicated."}
{"text": "We can define these prosumers as owners and occupiers of buildings who realizing that they are now also producing electricity but being paid little for it by the “supply- side\"are joining together either physically with private wire networks or virtually through aggregators seeking ways to maximize value from their investment on power generation."}
{"text": "The shift we are seeing from central generation is still fledgling,but as successful business models are developed,it could well become a disruptive change."}
{"text": "28.6 Future of business models in the energy transition\n\nThe transformation of the UK's energy system is limited by an extensive range of chal- lenges.Firstly,the infrastructure of the UK's energy system has a large degree of path dependency,meaning that the process of decarbonization is conditioned by the his- torical pattern of energy generation within the country.As a consequence,significant political and economic changes are required in the United Kingdom,as otherwise new policy will be “locked in”to existing technologies [6].Secondly,decarbonization of the energy system involves a long infrastructural replacement period.Simultaneously, existing energy systems tends to replace infrastructure on a\"like-for-like\"basis, reducing diversity in investment patterns.However,at this moment in time,using renewable technologies poses a financial and investment risk,as they are characterized by both high capital costs and low running costs [7]."}
{"text": "As with the transformation of city transport through carsharing and \"Uber\"effects, the UK's energy system now faces new challenges and must now consider alternative business models to successfully deliver energy security,equity,and environmental sustainability.Currently research into business model innovation in the energy sector is becoming very important."}
{"text": "The transition toward renewable and decentralized energy systems can occur simultaneously with the shift away from governance of corporate utility,toward a more diverse mix of community and citizen investors being involved in the generation of renewable energy [12].Local energy supply is being encouraged as a way to increase the participation of the community in the energy system [12]."}
{"text": "Currently,there are a number of different options available for those wishing to develop local supply and decentralized projects in the United Kingdom.These can be split into two categories:projects that involve a partnership between the generator and a supplier,and projects that rely purely on self-supply."}
{"text": "As an example of\"prosumer\"impact,we will focus on a\"demand-side response\", DSR business model.There are already other types of local supply models which have been developed in partnership with suppliers but our emphasis here is on the possi- bilities of change from outside the traditional energy industry."}
{"text": "28.8 Demand side response (DSR)\n\nLiterature classifies Demand Side Management into two different areas:(i)energy effi- ciency(EE),which involves reducing the demand for the provision of a service or product (Please note the EE business model is out of the scope of this Chapter).(ii)Demand-side response (DSR),which involves fluctuations in electricity demand as a response to changing electricity prices or incentives [13].DSR enables end users to alter their de- mand of electricity from the grid (or other output),as a result of signals from the current supplier,infrastructure or system operator [14].The main aim of DSR is to reduce energy consumption during various periods throughout the day,particularly those periods which are during peak time at power stations [15].According to Behrangrad [13],the DSR business model can be affected by various factors such as the market structure,the role of stakeholders within the electricity market,the capacity of the generation and trans- mission network,and the electricity tariff structure (see Fig.28.4)."}
{"text": "28.9.1 How it works\n\nBEN seeks to answer the UK's energy trilemma:delivering secure,affordable,and sus- tainable energy.Using a“Cold Water Heat Network”(ICAX)to move and store energy, linked with heat pumps and borehole thermal storage(TFGI),BEN provides the effi- ciency benefits of a heat network without the added pollution of energy centers in dense urban areas.BEN allows us to completely rethink how we provide heating and cooling services,simply moving heat away from a place that needs cooling,toward a place that needs heating.No combustion—just efficient energy management.That management is enabled by a cloud-based aggregator that delivers a Virtual Energy Storage(Upside).This set of algorithms tells BEN systems when to turn on and off,when to store electricity as heat,or when to deliver cooling by moving heat to storage.In short,it provides heating, cooling,and electricity at optimal times to create the world's first Balanced Energy Network."}
{"text": "BEN also creates an enabling infrastructure for a host of new technologies to make the grid electricity supply more robust and efficient.For example,Mixergy hot water tanks create a\"smart storage\"solution that both links with the Upside aggregator and improves the efficiency of heat pumps.Origen Power and Cranfield University have created a unique fuel cell that creates carbon negative electricity for BEN by actively removing CO₂from the atmosphere.The demonstration project at LSBU can also be linked to future buildings and energy technologies."}
{"text": "28.10 Local self-supply model—integration of renewable energy generation with battery storage\n\nAnother form of local supply business model is“local self-supply”this does not essen- tially require the involvement of a third party.Integration of renewable energy genera- tion with battery storage is an example of this model."}
{"text": "The integration of renewable energy with battery storage could have the potential to be an alternative model for localized projects in postsubsidy conditions because it enables renewable energy generators to create revenue as well as providing flexibility and reliability within the entire energy system.Electricity storage technologies can be implemented in different stages of the energy system,incuding generation,trans- mission,and distribution [16]."}
{"text": "The literature has also highlighted the importance of electricity storage in postsubsidy conditions in the United Kingdom (see e.g.,Refs.[17,18]).With the reduction of the feed- in tariff (FIT)rates,integration battery storage and renewable energy is an idea that has gained increasing attention and is now considered as a potential option for ensuring the sustainable generation of RE [18].However,currently it cannot be denied that the financial viability of this type of model is still in question,and further research is needed to assess its feasibility [19]."}
{"text": "Various scholars have begun to explore the potential opportunities of integrating battery storage and renewable energy,such as Jones et al. [18],who investigated the financial viability and life-cycle assessment (LCA)of solar PV systems,including battery storage within nondomestic buildings.The financial feasibility of integrating battery storage and wind farms has also been evaluated by Ref.[20].Other scholars have focused on the use of electricity storage at distribution level,evaluating its role in reducing de- mand during the peak times of a distribution network [21].The economic feasibility of using storage systems to implement peak shaving(reducing electricity demand during peak price period)has also been explored by Ref.[22].The majority of these studies indicate the low profitability of investing in storage in today's market conditions.This could be due to the fact that all studies have only considered one application of elec- tricity storage,whereas He et al.[16]highlight the importance of combining different types of battery storage applications in order to increase financial viability and we now look deeper at this."}
{"text": "28.11 Integrating solar PV with electricity storage to provide peak shaving and DSR services\n\nThis is a proposed approach which enables an individual nondomestic building with onsite renewable energy and storage(prosumer)to provide DSR services and balancing services."}
{"text": "Under this proposed model (Fig.28.6),a prosumer can benefit from“peak shaving”\n\nmeaning that they are able to store surpluses of electricity from solar PV or charge a battery from the grid when the electricity is cheap and discharge it during the peak demand when the electricity is expensive.This study concluded that the proposed approach in postsubsidies conditions (no FiT),combining of solar PV with battery storage in buildings would be more financially viable and have a shorter payback period compared to the Solar PV system without storage.Combining of solar PV with battery storage can reduce solar PV payback period from 14 years to between 4 and 7 years without the FIT."}
{"text": "storage in nondomestic buildings,prosumers wishing to generate revenue by providing balancing services should work in partnership with an Aggregator.An Aggregator works in collaboration with system operator (SO)including the National Grid to deliver balancing and DSR services.The majority of Aggregators work based on cloud services that aggregate the energy stored in the systems that the business or households already own such as stationary and mobile storage (e.g.,electric cars and battery storage). Which,create a virtual energy pool that can be sold to the National Grid to help grid stability and reduce its need for power stations (Fig 8)."}
{"text": "The combination of services including DSR and balancing services reduce the payback period and increases Net Present Value(NPV).However,the main economic value of electricity storage comes predominantly from peak shaving meaning avoiding network charges including transmission and distribution charges rather than balancing services."}
{"text": "28.12 Change by sector\n\nIn addition to business practices,the fundamental technologies that underpin the energy system are on the cusp of the greatest changes since the creation of the National Grid,and this places the core of the challenge within cities.Drastic changes will be made not only to buildings themselves,but to the systems and architecture that connect them."}
{"text": "The United Kingdom has already pledged to remove unabated coal (i.e.,without any treatment to reduce substantially the emissions of carbon dioxide)from power generation by 2025,and renewables are providing an increasingly cost competitive alternative to fossil fuels.The carbon intensity of the grid (currently at ~300 gCO₂e (kWh)-¹is reasonably projected to be below 100 gCO₂e(kWh)-¹by 2030,50 gCO₂e (kWh)-¹by 2040,and 30 gCO₂e(kWh-¹by 2050 [23].While far from simple,there is a relatively visible path toward a low-carbon power grid dominated by renewables,new nuclear,and interconnectors."}
{"text": "For low-carbon transportation,the United Kingdom has already declared that no new petrol and diesel cars can be sold beyond 2040 and many other countries have similar trajectories [24].There is clearly a role for government in creating the infrastructure required (e.g.,charging points),and in supporting take up,however,market forces are already driving down the cost of ultralow-emission vehicles(ULEVs).It is predicted that by 2030,anywhere from 30%to 70%of new vehicle sales will be ULEVs [24].As with the power sector,there is a challenging but realistic path toward low-carbon transportation by 2050."}
{"text": "Low-carbon heat will require changing the heating system and energy performance of approximately 23 million existing UK homes,and likely upgrading many of the 5-7 million new homes that will be built from now to 2050.The transition to low-carbon heat requires working at a rate of 20,000 homes per week for 25 years.While we gather evidence for major infrastructure decisions such as the future of the gas grid, there is a preparation phase that cannot be delayed.It requires vigorous action and pilot schemes that increasingly build the evidence base as well as the capacity of the market to deliver a successful transition [25].The issue is similar in the nondomestic sector."}
{"text": "The United Kingdom has ahead of them a period of 3-4 decades requiring a sus- tained policy effort to bring about this profound shift [26].Both the CCC and the UK gas and electricity regulator(Ofgem)argue that the near term steps should focus on active experimentation,rather than a\"wait-and-see\"approach [27]."}
{"text": "28.13 Electrification versus hydrogen\n\nThere are a number of enabling technologies such as heat pumps and energy networks that can improve the efficiency of heat delivery.However,in terms of core fuels there are really only two options:electricity from a green grid and carbon-free gas.Consider first the electrification of heat."}
{"text": "Electrification of heat primarily refers to heat pumps.There are potential efficiency gains through enabling technologies such as heat networks that will be discussed below. Heat pumps currently represent a minute fraction of heating in the United Kingdom (~2%)but there are calls to increase uptake by over 30 TWh (or 2 million units)(r)by 2030 [28]."}
{"text": "Heat pumps face a range of barriers in the United Kingdom from high upfront costs to low consumer confidence in the technology.Aside from these implementation issues, the core infrastructure challenge to heat pumps is the increase in peak loads that it imposes on the grid.This is the subject of much study,but also much uncertainty given the range of unknowns.If heat pumps were to make up between 60%and 80%of UK heat,then the increase in grid peak loads could be anywhere from 20%to 100% depending on the use of the thermal storage and smart controls [29]."}
{"text": "The main alternative to electrification is carbon-free gas.This typically means a green gas such as biomethane,or hydrogen.Biomethane production can realistically only meet a small fraction of UK heat demand.Hydrogen is the carbon-free gas with higher po- tential for scalability.Industrial scale hydrogen production typically comes from either electrolysis,steam methane reforming(SMR),or in small amounts as a by-product of other processes [27]."}
{"text": "SMR is likely the preferred option [27].SMR requires large-scale plant to convert natural gas into hydrogen and capture the carbon dioxide at source for sequestration. Hydrogen could then replace natural gas in the existing distribution pipe work.Due to the inherent similarities with gas,it is argued that this would represent a less intrusive transition for end users than a switch to heat pumps or heat networks.It does however face many practical hurdles including:\n\n-All natural gas using appliances would require replacements (most of which currently do not exist)."}
{"text": "-Both SMR and CCS technology are currently underdeveloped."}
{"text": "-There are considerable safety testing issues for every step in the new hydrogen sup- ply chain."}
{"text": "The theoretical as well as practical issues are currently being actively explored through the pilot H21 Leeds City Gate project.This is a study which aims to determine the technical and economic feasibility of converting the existing natural gas network in Leeds to 100%hydrogen [30].The UK government is undergoing an extensive evidence gathering process and aims to decide the future of the gas grid by 2025 [24]."}
{"text": "28.14 Smart-grids and multiple energy vectors\n\nUltimately low-carbon heat will be a combination of electricity and carbon-free gas. Operational flexibility will be at the core of a cost-effective and low-carbon energy system [31].The terms“smart-grid”and\"multiple energy vectors\"are frequently invoked to explain this new paradigm."}
{"text": "While definitions of smart-grids vary widely,the principle behind them is a bilateral flow of information in a network.The system until now largely consisted of centralized generation and one-way transmission to end users.This is evolving to include distrib- uted renewables generation,distributed storage,utility scale renewables,utility scale storage,and is also converting from radial networks to mesh networks.There is also a layer of communication networks that enable more intelligent control of these distrib- uted resources [32]."}
{"text": "This transition to a low-carbon economy will force us to rethink how buildings exist as actors in advanced energy infrastructure.In this,it is critical to move beyond his- torical operation and design principles.There is a crucial opportunity to move from security that is largely delivered though costly asset redundancy toward smart corrective control measures that enhance the utilization of existing assets and a more cost-effective integration of low-carbon technologies [31]."}
{"text": "Energy storage technologies can also contribute to system balancing,ancillary services,and network management [31].DSR is a type of virtual storage that can redistribute consumption and engage demand side resources as balancing services to enhance flexibility [31].DSR is currently small,approximately 1.3-1.6 GW in 2015/16 [33] but it is a rapidly increasing area of interest for academics,policy-makers, and entrepreneurs.The Clean Growth Strategy pathway suggested that 70%of extracapacity and flexibility by 2032 will come from DSR [24] ,and a study found that over the next 50 years,DSR could deliver a cost savings of f60 billion for the UK power system [34]."}
{"text": "The need for smart grids and multiple energy vectors is likely to lead to expanded role for enabling technologies such as heat networks.In particular,it has the potential to expand the range of what typically constitutes a heat network to include distributed storage,heat sharing,and DSR-based control systems [38] ."}
{"text": "28.15 Future energy professionals\n\nThe world's cities account for about three-quarters of global carbon emissions [39]. There are a number of efforts driving innovation at the city level.In 2016,they convinced 533 cities to disclose climate change related data.They use the data to facilitate net- works,particularly to access private sector investment to support city green infrastruc- ture projects.In the United Kingdom,the UK100 effort has 78 local leaders committed to 100%clean energy by 2050 [40]."}
{"text": "And, obviously, all energy systems evolve. During the preindustrial era there were only very slow changes in the composition of the primary energy supply (dominated by biomass fuels) and in the use of prime movers (dominated by human and animal muscles)—but the last two centuries have seen a series of remarkable energy transitions. These changes can be traced (and where statistics allow, be studied in revealing quantitative details) as shifts in the shares of indi- vidual fuels and in the origins of electricity generation as well as the adoption and diffusion rates of new prime movers and as new patterns of ﬁnal energy uses. Scores of books could be consulted to get a more detailed understanding of the matters introduced in this chapter: Fouquet (2008), Smil (2003, 2008), and WEC (2007) might be convenient places to start."}
{"text": "The spectrum of solar radiation contains the shortest gamma rays and x-rays, ultraviolet light (<400 nm), visible wavelengths (400–700 nm), and infrared (>700 nm). Nearly all of the UV wavelengths are screened by the stratospheric ozone layer, almost exactly 30% of the incoming radiation is reﬂected back to space and 20% is absorbed by the atmosphere; as a result, solar energy reaching the ground is only half of the solar ﬂux in space. Active use of solar energy to generate electricity or to produce hot water is still rather limited, but all build- ings have always beneﬁted from passive solar heating, and architectural design can enhance this reality by optimizing the orientation of buildings, ingress of winter rays into rooms, and blocking of summer rays."}
{"text": "Photosynthesis uses only a small part of available wavelengths (principally blue and red light amounting to less than half of the energy in the incoming spectrum) and its overall conversion efﬁciency is no more than 0.3% when mea- sured on the planetary scale and only about 1.5% for the most productive terres- trial (forest) ecosystems. Phytomass produced by photosynthesis is dominated by carbohydrates and absolutely dry phytomass has a fairly uniform energy density of about 18 MJ/kg; air-dry wood, the most important fuel for household heating and cooking and small-scale manufacturing in all preindustrial societies, con- tains about 15 MJ/kg, as do various cereal and legume straws and stalks that have been burned by households in arid and deforested regions."}
{"text": "There are four other water-based energy resources: tidal power and, as already noted, wind-driven waves, ocean currents, and the difference in temperature between the warm ocean surface and cold deeper waters. Each of them has a sig- niﬁcant overall global potential but none of them is easy to harness. Large-scale tidal projects have remained in the conception/proposal stage for decades, wave-harnessing devices are in their early development stage, there have been no serious attempts to capture the power of major ocean currents, and even in the warmest tropical seas (where the difference between the surface and deep water surpass 20°C) the ocean thermal differences can be tapped for electricity generation only with a very low efﬁciency and none of a few isolated experiments with such generation had progressed to commercial projects."}
{"text": "Fossil fuels are by far the most important nonrenewable energies: All coals and most hydrocarbons (crude oils and natural gases) are transformations of ancient biomass, buried in sediments and processed by high pressures and tem- peratures (for millions to hundreds of millions of years), but a signiﬁcant share of natural gases may be of abiogenic origin. All fossil fuels share the dominant presence of carbon, whose content ranges from nearly 100% in the best anthra- cite coals to 75% in methane; most common bituminous coals used in electricity generation, as well as most hydrocarbons, contain sulfur (a mere trace in some gases, up to 4% in some coals, with 2% being a common mean). Coals also con- tain varying shares of incombustible ash and moisture, as well as traces of heavy metals that are also present in many crude oils, and natural gases often contain dissolved nitrogen, water, and hydrogen sulﬁde."}
{"text": "Nuclear energy can be released either by ﬁssion of the isotopes of the heaviest natural elements (a process exploited in all nuclear electricity-generating plants) or by fusion of the lightest ones (a process whose commercial realization has been a frustratingly receding mirage). Since the late 1950s uranium ﬁssion has been used in commercial nuclear stations to generate electricity by the same means as in fossil-fueled stations (i.e., expanding the pressurized steam in a turbine that rotates a generator). In contrast, there are no fusion-based plants; none are even on a distant horizon and fusion may remain nothing but an ever-receding promise."}
{"text": "Division of energies into primary and secondary categories is based on the method of their production. Primary fuels (stores of chemical energy) are harvested (wood, crop residues) or extracted from the uppermost strata of the Earth’s crust (all fossil fuels, including peats, coals, crude oils, and natural gases). Their combus- tion provides heat (thermal energy) or light (electromagnetic or radiant energy). Their processing to yield secondary fuels may change only their physical state (making solid briquettes by compressing coal dust, with or without binders), but it usually involves chemical transformation."}
{"text": "Today’s most important, as well as by far the most common, secondary fuels are various liquids produced by reﬁning crude oils. Reﬁning was done initially by simple thermal distillation (fractions separated by temperature); now the crude oils are transformed with the help of catalytic cracking used to produce higher shares of gasoline and jet fuel (kerosene), lighter and more valuable fuels that power passenger cars and airliners. Heavier diesel oil is also used to fuel cars but its principal consumer is truck and railways transport, while the heaviest residual oil powers the marine transportation. Diesel oil and residual fuel oil are also used in stationary generation of electricity."}
{"text": "Commercial electricity generation and transmission added a new dimension to human energy use and,as in the case of fuels,electricity's origin is dassified as either primary or secondary.Primary electricity involves all conversions of natural,renewable energy flows induding those of water and wind,the Earths heat,and solar radiation.Primary electricity could also be generated by harnessing ocean waves and the temperature differences between the surface layer of the warmest ocean and constantly cold waters underneath.Nuclear electricity is yet another form of primary energy,with steam for large turbogenerators derived from controlled spliing of uranium.Secondary electricity uses heat released from the combustion of fossil fuels,mainly coal for steam turbogenerators and natural gas for gas turbines."}
{"text": "Major criteria used to classify energy uses, as well as the deployment of prime movers, are the location of the conversion process, temperature of the ﬁnal use, and principal economic sectors. Stationary combustion provides space heating for households, public institutions, and industries, as well as hot air and steam for industrial processes. Stationary prime movers (dominated by steam turbo- generators and water turbines) produce the world’s electricity and electric motors and internal combustion engines power most of the modern industrial processes. Heavy horses were the most powerful commonly used mobile prime movers in preindustrial societies. Mobile steam engines, introduced between 1805 and 1835, revolutionized both land and water transportation and dominated the two sectors until the middle of the twentieth century."}
{"text": "Mobile steam turbines were ﬁrst used in ship propulsion at the beginning of the twentieth century, but marine transport became eventually dominated by diesel engines. Diesels also power heavy road transport and a variety of off- road vehicles, while the automotive gasoline-fueled internal combustion engines emerged as the world’s most numerous mobile prime movers. Commercializa- tion of gas turbines began during the late 1930s but their widespread adoption had to wait until the 1960s. Larger stationary machines are used mostly in elec- tricity generation and, starting in the 1950s, lighter and increasingly powerful gas turbines rapidly displaced reciprocating internal combustion engines in long-distance air travel. During the 1980s modiﬁed jet engines began to be used also for stationary applications as aeroderivative turbines for peak demand or decentralized electricity generation."}
{"text": "CONVERSIONS AND USES\n\nModern societies use many forms of energy in order to satisfy many ﬁnal uses."}
{"text": "While such considerations as comfort and convenience are hardly unimpor- tant, the quest for higher conversion efﬁciencies underlies the evolution of modern energy systems. The simplest deﬁnition of energy conversion is as the ratio of output or transfer of the desired energy kind achieved by a converter to the initial energy input (be it to an organism, a mechanical device or a com- plex system). This rate does not capture the efﬁciency limitations due to the sec- ond law. The second-law (or exergy) efﬁciency is expressed as the ratio of the least available work that could have performed the task to the available work that has been actually used in performing it. This measure provides a direct insight into the quality of performance relative to the ideal process, and it is concerned with a task to be performed, not with a device or a system used for that end."}
{"text": "Rising efﬁciency of individual conversions has been reﬂected in the improving performance of entire economies. As a result, the difference between average per capita energy use in modern and traditional societies is signiﬁcantly greater when compared in useful terms rather than as the rates of gross energy consumption. For example, thanks to a relatively easy access to extensive and rich forests, the average U.S. wood and charcoal consumption was very high: about 100 GJ/capita in 1860, compared to about 350 GJ/capita for all fossil and biomass fuel at the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century. But as the typical 1860 combustion efﬁcien- cies were only around 10%, the useful energy reached only about 10 GJ/capita. Weighted efﬁciency of modern household, industrial, and transportation conver- sions is about 40% and hence the useful energy serving an average American is now roughly 150 GJ/year, nearly 15-fold higher than during the height of the biomass era."}
{"text": "Energy uses have undergone some signiﬁcant changes even during the prein- dustrial period when most fuels were used by households and in small-scale arti- sanal manufactures, and when most prime movers were deployed in subsistence agriculture. Expansion of manufactures and metallurgy led to a spreading use of water power (most efﬁciently by larger vertical water wheels) and iron metal- lurgy and the preference for smokeless fuel in richer urban homes had also cre- ated higher demand for charcoal. Crop rotations including leguminous food and cover crops enabled farmers to divert a greater share of harvests to animal feeding and made it possible to deploy larger numbers of more powerful animals in agriculture."}
{"text": "Industrialization brought a radical change in the composition of national energy use as coal mining, metallurgy, and heavy machinery sectors became eventually the leading consumers of energy, followed by light manufactures (textiles and various consumer items) and a rapidly expanding land and sea transportation. In Europe and North America this shift was accomplished already before 1900. Households claimed a relatively small share of overall energy use during the early phases of industrialization, ﬁrst only as coal (or coal briquettes) for household stoves, later also as low-energy coal (town) gas, and (starting during the 1880s) as electricity for low-power light bulbs, and soon afterwards also for numerous household appliances."}
{"text": "But the boundaries of standard sectoral classiﬁcation can be redrawn to yield a different breakdown. Perhaps most notably, modern agriculture consumes directly only a few percent of the total energy supply as fuels and electricity to operate ﬁeld machinery (tractors, combines, irrigation pumps) and mostly as electricity for heating, cooling, and machinery used in large-scale animal husbandry. But the indirect energy cost of agricultural production (to produce agricultural machinery, and to synthesize energy-intensive fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides) and, even more so, energy costs of modern industrial food processing (including excessive packaging), food storage (the category domi- nated by refrigeration), retailing, cooking, and waste management raise the aggregate cost of the entire food production/distribution/preparation/disposal system to around 15% of total energy supply."}
{"text": "Inevitably, changing sectoral requirements have affected the ﬁnal uses. Before the advent of extensive steam-driven electricity generation (during the 1890s), coal had four major ﬁnal uses: as the leading household fuel, as the principal source of both process heat and steam and mechanical power in industries, as the prime energizer of land and water transport, and as the feedstock to produce metallurgical coke needed to smelt pig iron. A century later, coal ceased to be an important transportation fuel, only in a few countries was it still used for house- hold heating and cooking, and its rising use was conﬁned largely to only two markets, the dominant one for electricity generation and a smaller one for coke production."}
{"text": "INFRASTRUCTURES AND IMPACTS\n\nOnly the simplest harnessing and conversion of energies (gathering of woody debris and its burning in primitive stoves) does not require special infrastruc- tures whose existence must either precede a particular form of energy use or must accompany its expansion. Some early infrastructures could be relatively simple. For example, in the eighteenth century an unpaved road leading to a coal seam outcropping in a previously uninhabited valley would make it possible to bring in the material necessary for opening a small mine and to haul the mined coal in horse-drawn wagons to the nearest settlement. But a large nineteenth century mine would have to be connected to its markets by a railroad, or its coal would be shipped by barges, and the mining of deeper seams could not be accom- plished without ﬁrst installing adequate steam-powered water pumping and ventilation facilities."}
{"text": "Infrastructural needs reached an entirely new level with the exploitation of hydrocarbons whose large-scale extraction requires complex and expensive infra- structures. Pipelines are needed to carry the crude oil and natural gas to markets (or to the nearest coast for overseas exports) and a pretreatment (separation of water, brine, petroleum gases, or hydrogen sulﬁde) may be required before send- ing such fuels by a pipeline. When natural gas is used for household heating it is necessary to have voluminous storages to meet high winter peak demand. Crude oil is too valuable a resource to be burned as is and it needs expensive reﬁning that converts it into gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, residual oil, and non-energy products (lubricants, paving materials)."}
{"text": "Energy systems have also become more interdependent and their integration has been steadily expanding. Preindustrial energy systems were just patchworks of independent entities. Their spatial extent could have been as small as a village that relied on nearby forests and on crop residues for all ofits fuel and feed needs and that produced virtually all of its food by growing a variety of crops in rota- tions. Modernization began to enlarge the boundaries of energy systems, ﬁrst with railway and shipborne transport of coal, then with increasingly large-scale production of industrial manufactures that were traded not only nationwide but even overseas and with adoption of simple agricultural machines."}
{"text": "Today’s energy system is truly global, with nearly 50 countries exporting and almost 150 nations importing crude oil (and with nearly as many trading reﬁned oil products), with more than 20 states involved in natural gas sales (either by cross-border pipelines or by using tankers carrying liqueﬁed gas), and with nearly a dozen major coal importers and a similar number of countries with substantial coal imports. Electricity is traded relatively less than coal, but even so at least two dozen countries have interconnections of sufﬁcient capacity to carry on exchanges on a GW scale. Moreover, there are no national autarkies as far as extraction, transportation, and processing of energy is concerned: Mining machinery, oil and gas drilling rigs, pipelines, tankers, and coal-carrying vessels and reﬁneries are designed and made by a relatively small number of producers in about a score of countries and used worldwide."}
{"text": "And design and production of the most powerful prime movers have seen an even greater degree of concentration, with as few as two or three companies dominating the global market. All of the world’s largest marine diesel engines that power virtually all large commercial vessels (oil and gas tankers, bulk car- riers, container ships) come from the duopoly of MAN Diesel and Wrtsil (and the companies license their engines to a small number of makers in Europe and Asia) and all of the world’s most powerful jet engines are designed and made by America’s General Electric and Pratt & Whitney and Britain’s Rolls-Royce, or by alliances of these companies."}
{"text": "Global growth of primary energy consumption has corresponded fairly closely to the expansion of the world’s economic product: During the twentieth century a roughly 17-fold expansion of annual commercial energy use (from about 22 to approximately 380 EJ) produced a 16-fold increase of annual economic output, from about $2 to $32 trillion in constant 1990 dollars (Maddison, 1995; World Bank, 2001). Similarly close relationship is revealed by studying historical statistics of many individual countries—but comparisons among the countries clearly indicate that a given level of economic development does not require an identical, or not even very similar, level of the total primary energy consumption. This is true among low-income economies as well as among afﬂuent nations: France has certainly a much higher standard of living than Russia even though the two countries consume primary energy at a very similar per capita rate."}
{"text": "Fewer exceptions are found as far as the secular decline of average energy inten- sity (energy use per unit of GDP) is concerned. That rate’s rise during the early stages of industrialization (reﬂecting energy needs for new industrial and transpor- tation infrastructures) is usually followed by a prolonged decline. The British peak came early in the nineteenth century, the U.S. and Canadian peaks followed six to seven decades later—but Japan reached its highest energy intensity only in 1970, and China’s energy use per unit of the country’s GDP continued to rise until the late 1970s but since that time the Chinese rate has fallen faster than in any previous case: By 1990 it was 40% below the 1980 level, and by 2005 the decline reached just over 70% (Fridley et al., 2008). But comparisons of national energy intensities and their secular trends require careful interpretation because their differences are caused by factors ranging from climate to consumer preferences, with the compo- sition of primary energy consumption and the structure and efﬁciency of ﬁnal conversions as key factors."}
{"text": "But energy prices have not been usually determined by free-market operation, as energy industries in general (and oil industry and nuclear electricity genera- tion in particular) have been among the greatest beneﬁciaries of government sub- sidies, tax breaks, and special regulation. Some prices have been subject to cartel control: In the United States the Texas Railroad Commission ﬁxed prices by allocating production quotas until March 1971, and since 1973 OPEC has used its production quota to manipulate the global crude oil supply. Even more importantly, no energy price expresses the real cost of the delivered service, as the costs of often signiﬁcant environmental and health externalities are not included in the prices of fuels or electricity."}
{"text": "Internalization of these costs has been done adequately in some cases (electricity cost is higher due to highly efﬁcient capture of particulate matter by electrostatic precipitators and removal of SO2 by ﬂue gas desulfurization; all modern passenger cars have three-way catalytic converters to reduce NOx, CO, and volatile organic hydrocarbon emissions) but it remains a challenge in most instances, above all because health effects account for most of the cost but are notoriously difﬁcult to monetize—as are the long-term ecosystemic effects of such complex processes as photochemical smog, acid deposition, nitrogen enrichment, or climate change. Strategic considerations further complicate the quest for the real price of energy: Perhaps most notably, the Pentagon had been devoting a signiﬁcant share of its budget to the Middle East even before the 1991 Gulf War or before the Iraqi invasion of 2003."}
{"text": "As for the environmental impacts of energy industries and uses, it is clear that the anthropogenic emissions of CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels have become one of the most prominent concerns of modern civilization."}
{"text": "Extraction and transportation of crude oil created local water pollution and accidental oil spills, and combustion of reﬁned oil products provided the key starting ingredients (NOx, CO, and volatile organic compounds) for photo- chemical smog. Beginning in 1956 generation of electricity by ﬁssioning ura- nium introduced an entirely new set of environmental problems, ranging from possibilities of accidental contamination to challenges of long-term storage of high-level radioactivity waste. And renewable energy ﬂows have a multitude of their own environmental consequences, ranging from the alterations of water quality and age caused by large dams (lower temperature, water aging behind dams) to problems with esthetic acceptability of large wind turbine farms and with their noise and effect on birds."}
{"text": "As this book’s principal aim is a comprehensive appraisal of energy transitions— on levels ranging from global to national and looking at trends ranging from aggre- gate provision of primary energies to speciﬁc supplies of individual fuels and progress of important conversion techniques—I will use this introductory section only in order to make several general observations by resorting to analogies. When appropriately understood—that is, in an illuminating, suggestive manner and not as rigid templates—analogies are a useful tool to emphasize important features of a complex process. I think that two of them, of widely differing provenience, are particularly relevant to the understanding of energy transitions."}
{"text": "In contrast, large economies, particularly those with relatively high per capita demand and with extensive infrastructures serving an established fuel, cannot accomplish the substitutions so rapidly. Comparing the Dutch and the British experience is particularly revealing in this respect, as both of these countries beneﬁted from major natural gas discoveries. The ﬁrst discoveries of natural gas in the British sector of the North Sea were made by BP in 1965 but despite an aggressive development of those rich and relatively near-shore deposits, Britain could not accomplish even in 30 years what the Netherlands did in a decade: Its share of natural gas stood at a bit less than 5% of the primary energy supply in 1970 and it peaked only 30 years later at about 39%."}
{"text": "The second analogy illuminating the process of energy transitions is their com- parison with aircraft accidents. Careful studies of those events show that they are nearly always due to a number of factors and that the ﬁnal outcome is a result of a speciﬁc sequence of errors (be they actions or inactions) taken by crews in response to a sudden change, be it a faulty indicator light, erroneous instrument reading, or (an increasingly rare occurrence with modern gas turbines) mechanical failure of one or more of the airplane’s engines. And so it is with energy transitions: They are never brought about by a single factor, and in the second chapter I will show that this was the case even with perhaps the most commonly cited claim, por- traying English wood shortages as the decisive factor forcing the country’s early transition to coal."}
{"text": "And, as with the aircraft accidents, a careful investigation of energy transitions always reveals that their progress requires a speciﬁc sequence of scientiﬁc advan- ces, technical innovations, organizational actions, and economic and political and strategic circumstances. Missing a single component in such a sequence, or delaying its introduction or effects because of some unforeseen events, results in very different outcomes and in lengthier transition periods. Once again, an excellent example illustrating this necessity of a speciﬁc sequence, and of assorted events delaying its progress, is provided by the recent emergence of LNG as a globally available fuel traded competitively on an intercontinental basis."}
{"text": "Post–WWII surfeit of cheap crude oil and rapid expansion of North American gas extraction had postponed the beginning of the LNG era for another generation: The ﬁrst demonstration shipment of LNG (from Lake Charles, LA to Canvey Island on the Thames) took place in 1959 with a tanker of just 5,000 m3 (Methane Pioneer, a converted WWII Liberty class freighter). The ﬁrst methane liquefaction plant was completed in Arzew, Algeria in 1964 and LNG exports to the United Kingdom began in the same year with two speciﬁcally designed tankers (Methane Princess and Methane Progress) of 27,400 m3 each (Corkhill, 1975). They were followed by the Japanese imports from Alaska in 1969 and the French imports from Libya in 1970. But then the Groningen and the North Sea gas made the LNG imports uneconomical and when the Arzew–Canvey contract expired in 1979 it was not renewed."}
{"text": "These realities were not conducive to any bold technical advances. For more than a generation, between the mid-1960s and the late 1990s, typical capacities of LNG trains (liquefaction units) remained at just 1–2 Mt/year, while the aggregate outputs of entire plants increased only gradually, from the pioneer Arzew’s rate of 0.45 Mt/year in 1964 to 1 Mt/year in 1970, 1.5 Mt/year in 1980, 2.2 Mt/year in 1990, and 3.5 Mt/year in 2000. Some of these large- scale liqueﬁers have used the classic cascade cycle but most of them have relied on a mixed refrigerant cycle (using such gases as butane, propane, ethane, and nitrogen) devised by A. P. Kleemenko in 1960. And although the largest ship capacities increased fairly rapidly during the ﬁrst decade of LNG trade—from 27,400 m3 for the two pioneering ships in 1964 to 71,500 m3 in 1969 and 126,227 m3 in 1975—three decades later the dominant sizes (largely due to the Japanese restrictions on the maximum tonnage of LNG tankers) were still between 125,000 and 130,000 m3."}
{"text": "Given a limited number of exporting countries (1 in 1964, 6 by 1980, 12 by 2000) and LNG tankers (fewer than 60 vessels until 1984, 100 by 1997), this slow capacity growth meant that the total LNG trade surpassed 50 Mt/year only by 1991 and that only in 1999 did it carry more than 5% of all exported gas (Castle, 2007). The industry began to change rapidly at the century’s turn. Qatar joined the ranks of LNG exporters in 1997, in 1999 a new LNG plant in Trinidad and Tobago led to the reactivation of the two closed U.S. regasiﬁcation plants (Elba Island in 2001, Cove Point in 2003), Nigeria and Oman began ship- ping LNG in 2000, followed by Egypt in 2005, Equatorial Guinea in 2007, and Russia (from Sakhalin) in 2009."}
{"text": "Increasing train size (maxima of 5 Mt/year by 2005, more than 8 Mt/year by 2008) and decreasing costs of train and tanker construction resulted in rapid capacity increases and bold plans for further expansion. Total export capacity rose from 100 Mt/year in 2000 to about 220 Mt/year by 2009. For three decades the standard LNG tanker design used large aluminum spheres (Kvaerner-Moss shells introduced in 1971) covered with insulation inside steel tanks and bolted to the vessel’s hull. This design wastes storage space and steel spheres increase the ship’s draft, making voluminous vessels impractical. In contrast, membrane design has insulated tanks of thin stainless steel shaped to ﬁt the inner hull. As a result, average size of ships ordered in 2007 was about 180,000 m3 and Qatargas has taken delivery of the ﬁrst tankers belonging to new Q-Flex (210,000 m3) and Q-Max (266,000 m3) classes of ships. The company will eventually have 45 of these large vessels (Qatargas, 2009)."}
{"text": "If we take the years between 1999 (when worldwide LNG exports surpassed 5% of all natural gas sales) and 2007 (when the number of countries exporting and importing LNG surpassed 30, or more than 15% of all nations) as the onset of LNG’s global importance, then it had taken about four decades to reach that point from the time of the ﬁrst commercial shipment (1964), about ﬁve decades from the time that natural gas began to provide more than 10% of all fossil energies (during the early 1950s), more than a century since we acquired the technical means to liquefy large volumes of gases (by the mid-1890s)—and about 150 years since the discovery of the principle of gas liquefaction."}
{"text": "By 2007 it appeared that nothing could stop an emergence of a very substan- tial global LNG market. But then a sudden supply overhang that was created in 2008—and that was due to the combination of rapid capacity increases, lower demand caused by the global ﬁnancial crisis, and the retreat of U.S. imports due to increased domestic output of unconventional gas—has, once again, slowed down global LNG prospects, and it may take years before the future course will become clear. In any case, the history of LNG remains a perfect example of the complexities and vagaries inherent in major energy transitions."}
{"text": "This situation did not change fundamentally even during the early modern era when some Western European societies began a small-scale extraction of coal (or peat) and when they adopted increasingly more efﬁcient and more powerful water wheels and windmills. The two fundamental transitions, from biomass to fossil fuels and from animate to inanimate prime movers, have taken place only during the last few centuries (roughly three in the case of some European societies) or just a few recent decades (six in China’s, four in India’s case), and the emergence of electricity as the energy form of the highest quality began only during the 1880s. Inevitably, these transitions began on small local scales, evolved into nationwide developments, and eventually became truly global phenomena. Only the earliest innovators were able to maintain their advantage for a period of time, while the more recent advances have been diffusing with only a minimum lag (a phenome- non perhaps best illustrated by China’s rapid post-1980 modernization)."}
{"text": "GRAND FUEL SEQUENCE: FROM BIOMASS TO COAL AND HYDROCARBONS\n\nAll preindustrial societies had a rather simple and persistent pattern of primary fuel use as they derived all of their limited heat requirements from burning biomass fuels. Fuelwood (ﬁrewood) was the dominant source of primary energy, but woody phytomass would be a better term: the earliest users did not have any requisite saws and axes to cut and split tree trunks, and those tools remained beyond the reach of the poorest peasants even during the early modern era. Any woody phytomass was used, including branches fallen to the ground or broken off small trees, twigs, and small shrubs. In large parts of the sub-Saharan Africa and in many regions of Asia and Latin America this woody phytomass, collected mostly by women and children, continues to be the only accessible and affordable form of fuel for cooking and water and house heating for the poorest rural families."}
{"text": "And in households the universal reliance on phytomass combustion had evolved from using inefﬁcient open hearths to burning wood in stoves with proper chimneys. These stoves were a surprisingly late innovation, beginning with tiled Kachelofen (common in Central Europe by the sixteenth century), and with various iron stove designs introduced during the eighteenth century (including the famous but misleadingly named Franklin stove in 1742: it was actually just an iron-lined ﬁreplace). At the same time industries introduced more efﬁcient, larger furnaces and steam-generating boilers, and iron makers began to convert wood to charcoal on a massive scale needed to feed larger blast furnaces. As a result, growing cities, expanding manufactures, and increasing iron production led to the demise of surrounding forests, and affordable avail- ability of nearby wood or charcoal supplies (as long-distance land transport using pack or draft animals was usually prohibitively expensive) became a key factor limiting the size of preindustrial cities and the level of iron output."}
{"text": "Unfortunately, we have no reliable records of ancient or medieval household biomass fuel consumption, and even for the early modern era and the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries there is only some highly fragmentary information from a few countries. The United States, with some fuelwood data going back to the seventeenth century, is perhaps the most important exception. And, of course, in some regions household use was easily equalled or surpassed by industrial demand of iron- or glassmaking or for salt production. German medieval glass- making was particularly wood-intensive, with as much as 2.4 t of wood (97% of it burned to obtain potassium rather than energy) used per kg of glass, an equiva- lent of 90 MJ/kg (Sieferle, 2001). Salt works using large heated pans to evaporate brines produced (depending on salt concentration) 15–100 kg of salt/m3 wood, demanding as much as 500–600 MJ/kg."}
{"text": "Classical cases of energy transition from biofuels to fossil fuels (both in the sense of being the most consequential for the subsequent economic advancement and the best studied from historical and technical perspectives) involve gradual shifts from total reliance on fuelwood and charcoal to increasing uses of coal, in both domestic and industrial settings. But that sequence, best known from devel- opments in England, Germany, or the United States, has not been a universal phe- nomenon. As I will describe in the next chapter when detailing several prominent energy transitions on the national level, there was an interesting early exception when the Golden Age of the Dutch Republic (1608–1672) was energized by a unique shift from biofuels to peat, the youngest of all fossil fuels, aided consider- ably by a widespread use of wind power (de Zeeuw, 1978; Unger, 1984)."}
{"text": "And during the twentieth century many Asian and African countries with abundant hydrocarbon resources but with no domestic coal deposits moved from the biofuel era directly to the use of reﬁned oil products and natural gas, with some desert countries moving from very low per capita consumption rates of biomass fuels to some of the world’s highest per capita rates of hydrocarbon use in just two generations. But, without exception, all of the world’s major economies—the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, Japan, China, and India—had followed the classical sequence from biofuels to coal, and that is why this transition should receive the closest attention."}
{"text": "During the earliest stage of small-scale local coal extraction there was no need to discover the fuel and to develop elaborate mines: The ﬁrst seams to be tapped were those outcropping to the surface or those under only a shallow overburden and accessible by open pits or short shafts. In some places and at different times— ranging from the Roman Britain of the ﬁrst two centuries CE to Arizona Hopis of the thirteenth century—coal was used locally for heating, and its ﬁrst metallur- gical uses were during the Han dynasty, where the fuel was packed around iron ore-ﬁlled crucibles (Needham, 1964). The oldest European extraction is docu- mented in Belgium in 1113 and London received its ﬁrst coal deliveries in 1228 but, as Nef (1932) noted, until the sixteenth century the fuel was regularly burned only by poor households who could not afford to buy wood and lived close to coal outcrops."}
{"text": "Britain was circumventing its early eighteenth-century local charcoal short- ages by iron imports from Sweden and by lowering the rate of charcoal use in smelting. Coke was successfully used in iron smelting by Abraham Darby in 1709, but it was too costly (because of its inefﬁcient production) and its wide- spread acceptance came only after 1750 (Harris, 1988). Coke, much less friable than charcoal, made it possible to build taller, more voluminous blast furnaces and due to its higher temperature of combustion it also produced better iron. By 1800 Britain was extracting about 9 Mt of coal a year while U.S. production was only about 100,000 t, most of it coming from Pennsylvania (both bituminous coal and anthracite) with smaller contributions from Virginia, West Virginia, and eastern Kentucky (Milici, 2003)."}
{"text": "crisis was above alla timber crisis rather than a matter ofenergy shortages,it is also dlear that the country's wood supply could not have supported economic growth associated with industrialization.Wood shortages did precipitate the transition to coal,but only coal could sustain the country's famously rapid post-1870 industrialization."}
{"text": "Three grand trends marked the global coal production of the twentieth century: continuous decline of its relative importance, continuous growth of its absolute contribution to the worldwide total of primary energies, and the transformation from a highly labor-intensive to a highly mechanized industry. In 1900 global extraction of hydrocarbons was only marginally important; by 2000 they far surpassed coal’s contribution. In 1900 the worldwide extraction of bituminous coals and lignites added up to about 800 Mt; a century later it was about 4.5 Gt, a roughly 5.6-fold increase in mass terms and (because of the declining energy den- sity of extracted coal) almost exactly four-fold increase in energy terms. Much as fuelwood energized the early stages of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century industri- alization, coal energized the building of modern industries and infrastructures in all European countries as well as in North America, Australia, and Japan during the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, and the fuel continues to play a critical role not only in China and India but also in the United States and Europe because of its contribution to electricity generation."}
{"text": "Oil from natural seeps in western Pennsylvania was collected during the late eighteenth century and bottled to be sold as a medicinal ‘‘Seneca oil,’’ and crude oil, although not in its liquid form, was also known in preindustrial Europe in the form of oil sands in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn in Alsace where the ﬁrst shallow (9.75-m) pit was dug in 1745, the ﬁrst reﬁnery was built in 1857, water injection began in 1879, and small-scale production continued until 1970 (Walther, 2007). There was only one locality in the preindustrial world where active steps were taken to collect crude oil, the Absheron peninsula of the Baku region on the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan. Baku’s oil pools and wells were described by medieval Arabic travelers and historians, and in 1593 an inscription was afﬁxed near a 35-m deep well that was dug manually in Balakhani (Mir-Babaev, 2004)."}
{"text": "By the time Czarist Russia took over Baku (in 1806) the Absheron region had many shallow wells from which lighter oil was collected in order to produce kerosene (by thermal distillation) and use it for local lighting as well as for export by camels (carried in skins) and in wooden barrels on small ships. In 1837 Russians built the ﬁrst commercial oil-distilling factory in Balakhani and nine years later they sank the world’s ﬁrst (21-m deep) exploratory oil well in Bibi-Heybat and thus opened up what was later classiﬁed as the world’s ﬁrst giant oilﬁeld (i.e., one having at least 500 million barrels of recoverable crude oil). Baku was thus the place where the modern oil era began, and 1846 was its beginning."}
{"text": "North American developments followed soon afterwards, spurred by the search for an alternative source of lighting to replace whale oil (Brantly, 1971). In 1858 Charles Tripp and James Miller Williams ﬁnanced America’s ﬁrst (man- ually dug) oil well near Black Creek (Lambton County in southwestern Ontario) and a year later, amidst the world’s ﬁrst oil boom, the hamlet was renamed Oil Springs. And 1859 was also the year of the ﬁrst commercial U.S. oil discovery as Edwin Drake (employed by George Bissell, who started the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company) supervised the drilling of a shallow well at an oil seep site at Oil Creek near Titusville, Pennsylvania. The well (whose drilling used an ancient Chinese percussion method, but powered by steam engine) struck oil at the depth of 21 m on August 27, 1859, the date the Americans use as the beginning of the modern oil era."}

{"text": "In that year came also the ﬁrst large discovery in Kuwait, and in Saudi Arabia (Dammam on the western shore of the Persian Gulf near Dhahrn), followed by Abqaiq andAbu Hadrya in 1940, Qatfin 1945, and in 1948 al-Ghawr (south- west of Dhahrn), that was conﬁrmed by 1956 to be by far the world’s largest res- ervoir of crude oil. Canada also rejoined the ranks of major oil countries with the discoveries of giant oilﬁelds in Alberta (Leduc-Woodland in 1947 and Redwater in 1948) and the Soviet center of oil production shifted from Baku to the Volga-Ural region, where the ﬁrst strike in 1937 (giant Tuymazy) was followed by two more giants in 1945 and 1948 (Mukhanovo and Romashkino)."}
{"text": "Postwar recovery in Europe, the USSR, and Japan and the U.S. baby boom– driven economy stimulated demand for oil, as did the twin trend of rising car ownership and shift to suburbs, soon joined by the jet-powered air travel. Increasing networks of large-diameter pipelines and construction of massive crude oil supertankers made it possible to export the fuel at a very low cost, and general adoption of efﬁcient catalytic cracking enabled production of larger volumes of the most valuable transportation fuels, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil. Low oil prices also accelerated the transition from biofuels and coals in a number of Asian and Latin American countries."}
{"text": "Future of this increased supply seemed to be secure, as the 1950s and 1960s were the two record decades for the discovery of giant oilﬁelds. These ﬁnds included giants in Saudi Arabia (Safnya-Khafj, Manfa, Berri, Shayba), Iraq (Rumaila), Iran (Ahwaz, Marun, Fereidn), and Abu Dhabi (B Hasa, Zkm, Asab), as well as in Canada (Pembina, Weyburn-Midale, Swan Hills) and the United States (the Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope of Alaska in 1968) and the largest Soviet supergiant in Western Siberia (Samotlor in 1965). Discoveries in Algeria, Libya, and Nigeria made Africa into a major new supplier and a super- giant Daqing oilﬁeld in Heilongjiang (discovered in 1959) ﬁnally changed China’s meager oil fortunes."}
{"text": "Size of the Middle Eastern oilﬁelds and ready availability of Western (and later also Japanese) investments brought rapid extraction increases: For example, the Saudi output (all of it managed by the Arabian American Oil Company) tripled between 1960 and 1970 (from 62 to 192 Mt/year), while the Kuwaiti output went from less than 1 Mt in 1945 to more than 80 Mt by 1960. Dissatisfaction with low oil prices led to the establishment of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1960. As the oil demand continued to rise while the U.S. production began to fall in 1971 (it remained the world’s largest until 1975), OPEC began raising its prices. Its ﬁrst round of large increases in 1973– 1974 was followed by the second round in 1979–1981 that was precipitated by the overthrow of the Iranian monarchy."}
{"text": "Meanwhile another major change took place,as the USSR,the world's largest oil producer since 1975,dissolved,and the aggregate oil extraction of its former states declined by nearly a third between 1991 and 1996,making Saudi Arabia a new leader starting in 1993.Prices remained low and fairly steady and total extraction increased modestly during the first five years of the new millennium. Subsequent combination of a weaker U.S.dollar (all international oil trade is denominated in US$),speculation in commodity futures,and rising demand in China and India pushed them to new nominal(and demand-destroying) highs of nearly $150/bbl in July 2008 before they receded,and later somewhat rebounded.As a result,crude oil's share of the global primary fuel supply has been decining while the shares of coal and natural gas have been rising."}
{"text": "Moreover, in the cities natural gas faced a long-established competition by the gas made from coal (town gas, ﬁrst produced in London in 1812; in the United States, in Baltimore, in 1816), and by the 1880s gaslights began to be replaced by new electric lights. Three innovations had to take place before natu- ral gas could become a major household and industrial fuel: commercialization of a safe burner mixing the gas and air in correct proportion to produce a safe ﬂame for cooking and heating; introduction of large-diameter, high-pressure pipelines that could carry greater volumes of the gas over longer distances; and efﬁcient compressors to propel the gas through pipes. The ﬁrst advance began with Robert Bunsen’s burner in 1885 and it was perfected by temperature- regulating thermostats that could be used to monitor and regulate the ﬂame as needed."}
{"text": "Better pipes and pipeline construction method began to diffuse during the 1930s, but it was only after World War II when metallurgical advances and better welding and pipe-laying techniques brought a pipeline construction boom (with trunk lines having diameters up to 120 cm), ﬁrst in the United States, and by the 1960s also in Europe and parts of Asia. Another important post–WWII advance was the replacement of reciprocating engines or electric motors used in centrifu- gal compressors that pressurize the transported gas (and spaced in intervals of 60–160 km along the pipeline) by inherently more efﬁcient gas turbines which could be powered by consuming a small amount of the transported gas. These technical constraints were the main reason why—with the exception of the United States, where natural gas extraction rose to more than 10% of all fuel pro- duction by 1940—the gas industry became an important global presence only after World War II."}
{"text": "Canada has been the world's third-largest producer since the late 1950s and discoveries in the North Sea made the United Kingdom the fourth-largest pro- ducer.Algeria,Indonesia,Iran,the Netherlands,Uzbekistan,Kazakhstan,and Norway made up the rest of the global top ten in 2000.Growing LNG trade— by200915 countries,led by Qatar and followed by Malaysia,Indonesia,Algeria, Nigeria,Australia,and Trinidad and Tobago were exporting LNG and Japan, South Korea,Spain,the United States,Taiwan,and France were the main buyers—means that much less gas is now wasted,but in 2005 the share of flared gas,at about 4%of the global output,was still equal to nearly half of Russia's large exports(Mouton,2005).Gas-flaring sites in Russia,Iraq,Iran,and Nigeria can be seen on nighttime satellite images as the brightest spots on the Earth's surface."}
{"text": "And with the now universal reliance on electronic monitoring and auto- mation (be they in incubators or nuclear reactors, rapid trains or large banks) electricity’s role as the controller, regulator, and enabler of materials and infor- mation ﬂows became even more fundamental: Only a small share of its genera- tion energizes these controls—for example, the best calculations show that servers, modems, and routers consume about 3% of all U.S. electricity (Koomey, 2007) and that the Internet claims about 5% of the global electricity use (Sarokin, 2007)—but cessation of that supply would have profound effects on modern societies."}
{"text": "Most of the world’s electricity is generated by the burning of fossil fuels: In 2005 that share was almost exactly two-thirds, with coal accounting for more than 60% of the latter fraction, or just over 40% of the global total (WCI, 2009). Hydroelectricity came next with about 17%, followed by nuclear elec- tricity (just over 15%); despite their recent rapid expansion, all forms of new renewable electricity generation supplied only about 2% of the 2005 total, with most of it coming from wind turbines: In 2008, after doubling the 2005 installed capacity, their share was 1.5% of the global total (WWEA, 2009). Geothermal plants were the second-largest renewable contributor and photovoltaic (PV) conversion generated a minuscule share of less than 0.1%. Moving away from the reliance on fossil fuels in general (and from coal combustion in particular) would necessitate a massive reshaping of the industry."}
{"text": "And it would not matter if the shift toward renewables were to be motivated primarily by diminishing fossil fuel supplies obtainable at reasonable cost—as indicated by recent concerns about an imminent peak of oil production (Deffeyes, 2004; Goodstein, 2005), about exaggerated claims of coal reserves (Rutledge, 2008) or about declining energy returns on investment (Hall & Day, 2009)—or ifit were a result of a deliberate decision undertaken to prevent what is now increasingly seen as intolerable climate change, that is anything with average global tropospheric temperature more than 2°C above the preindustrial mean. I will return to all of these considerations in the book’s last chapter; here I will outline, as in the previous section where I traced the rise of fossil fuels, some of the milestones on the road to modern electriﬁed societies."}
{"text": "Some electric phenomena (most notably static electricity) were known for cen- turies, and experimental foundations of modern science of electricity were laid before 1850. Alessandro Volta (1745–1827) built the ﬁrst battery in 1800 (the unit of electromotive force bears his name), Hans Christian Ørsted (1777–1851) dis- covered the magnetic effect of electric currents in 1819 (the unit of magnetic ﬁeld strength is named after him), Andr-Marie Ampre (1775–1836) formulated the concept of a complete circuit and quantiﬁed the magnetic effects of electric cur- rents (the unit of electric current has his name), and in 1831 Michael Faraday (1791–1867) discovered the induction of electric current in a moving magnetic ﬁeld, the ﬁnding that was eventually translated into large-scale conversion of mechanical energy into electricity without bulky and heavy batteries able to deliver only limited power (farad is the unit of electrical capacitance)."}
{"text": "But it was only during the 1880s when this new form of energy became commercially available, with the ﬁrst electricity-generating plants serving only areas encompassing a few city blocks. Until that time fuels were the only, albeit very diverse, category of primary energies whose conversions could be used to heat rooms, cook food, generate mechanical energy for industrial processes or for transportation, and produce light, or be transformed into secondary fuels of all three states (charcoal, gasoline, town gas) that could have the same ﬁnal uses. Remarkably, electricity’s commercial introduction was not an outcome of a gradual accumulation of diverse developments but a matter of deliberate creation of an entire new energy system by a boldly thinking individual in one location."}
{"text": "Generation of primary electricity,that is,production of electric current without any fuel combustion,began at the same time.The first small American system based on water power was put in operation in the same month(September 1882) as the Manhattan station,and the first English hydro station began to generate electricity already a year earlier,in September 1881.Edison's first American hydroelectric station,with just 25kW of installed power produced by two small dynamos placed in a wooden shed,was energized by water rotating a small (107-cm diameter)wheel on the Fox River in Appleton,Wisconsin.The station was built for H.F Rogers,a paper manufacturer,it powered 280 weak light bulbs, and it was in operation for seven years(Dyer &Martin,1929).Godalming station, built by the Siemens brothers on the River Wey(in Surrey,south of Guildford),was also powered by a water wheel and its output was sufficient for just seven arc lights and 34 low-power incandescent bulbs(Electricity Council,1973)."}
{"text": "125 years, show no signs of weakening. The ﬁrst transition has been, in many ways, perhaps the most consequential shift in the modern energy use as increas- ingly larger shares of fossil fuels are not used directly to provide heat and motion but to generate thermal electricity. The second transition has seen the primary electricity claiming a growing share of the total primary energy supply: Until the 1950s almost all of that generation was done by the kinetic energy of water (with a very minor contribution from geothermal ﬂows), while since the 1950s primary electricity has originated from the combination of water and nuclear power joined (since the 1980s) by rising contributions from wind and most recently also by PV conversions. These different modes of electricity generation have had very different histories and they also face very different prospects."}
{"text": "There are at least four major reasons why thermal electricity generation took off so swiftly and has continued to expand so vigorously. The ﬁrst one is an undoubtedly brilliant Edisonian design of an entirely new energy system for generating, transmitting, and converting electricity: Between 1880 and 1882 Edison obtained (in addition to nearly 90 patents for improved incandescent lights) 60 patents for electric dynamos and their regulation, 14 patents for electric lighting systems, 12 patents for electricity transmission, and 10 patents for electric meters and motors (TAEP, 2002). The second reason is that while more than 125 years after its invention Edison’s grand concept of electricity system remains the foundation of the modern thermal electric industry, every one of its key com- ponents has been improved by a remarkable concatenation of technical advances that have made every aspect of the electric system more efﬁcient, more reliable, and more durable."}
{"text": "during the late 1880s,but Edison had dung to his original DC choice for a while(not so much because of his famous stubbornness but because of his vested commercial concerns),but by 1890 the so-called \"battle of systems\"was over, with AC triumphant.And as far as the first widely used electricity converter was concerned,Edison's carbon-filament lights gave way to incandescent metal- lic filaments(osmium in 1898,tantalum in 1901 and,finally,tungsten in 1912)."}
{"text": "Subsequent innovations have been neither continuous nor parallel.World War I,the worldwide economic depression of the 1930s,and World War II had an overwhelmingly negative effect on the growth of maximum capacities, efficiency improvements of steam turbines,and transmission networks.Stagnation of the 1930s was followed by higher war demand but most ofit was met (given the urgency of the situation)by replicating the well-established designs rather than by introducing new techniques.As a result,the maximum capacity of U.S.steam turbines rose swiftly from 1 MW in 1900 to more than 200 MW by the early 1930sbut the latter size was not surpassed until the late 1950s.Exponential growth then pushed the maximum unit capacity to 1,000 MW(1 GW)by 1967 and at that time it was widely anticipated that turbogenerators of 2 GW and larger would be installed before 1980;but the largest units reached only about\n\n1.5GWand a reverse trend had acually led to smaller units in new thermal power plants,a trend that was greatly enhanced by a growing reliance on gas turbines used to produce electricity during peak demand periods."}
{"text": "The third reason was the invention and rapid commercialization of a device that did not exist when Edison designed his ﬁrst electricity-generating stations: In 1888 Nikola Tesla patented his electric induction motor, a device that made it possible to convert electricity into mechanical energy with high efﬁciency and with precise control. Within a few decades after their introduction electric motors became the dominant prime movers in all industries (more on this in the next section) and they had also revolutionized household work as they began to power washing machines (ﬁrst on sale in the United States in 1907), vacuum cleaners (available since 1908), and household refrigerators (since 1912): Only in the United States had all of these machines diffused widely before World War II; in Europe and Japan their ownership became common only after 1945."}
{"text": "The fourth factor was the ability to harness the economies of scale by gener- ating electricity in stations of increasingly greater capacity and by transmitting it by interconnected HV lines not only to serve entire territories of such large nations as Germany or France but to create important markets for international electricity trade, ﬁrst in Europe and later also in North America. Larger stations were constructed by using multiple turbogenerators sharing large boilers. As a result, capacity of the largest U.S. thermal station rose from about 40 MW in 1900 to nearly 400 MW by the late 1930s and it surpassed 4 GW by the late 1970s, and the growth of average station capacities paralleled that rate by going from about 20 MW in 1930 to nearly 100 MW by 1960 and 400 MW by 1980 (Smil, 2003)."}
{"text": "Because the HV transmission voltages are a direct function of overall capacities of thermal electricity-generating plants, they experienced a similar exponential growth, albeit interrupted by the Great Depression and World War II. American HV lines reached maxima of 110 kV just before 1910 and 230 kV by 1923 but (the single exception of the Hoover Dam–Los Angeles 287.5-kV line, completed in 1936, aside) their exponential rate of growth resumed only in 1954 with the introduction of 345-kV lines; 500-kV lines fol- lowed during the early 1960s and a new maximum was reached by 1965 when the ﬁrst 1,100-km-long 765-kV line was installed by Hydro-Qubec to transmit electricity from Churchill Falls in Labrador to Montral."}
{"text": "International electricity trade began on a small scale between the two world wars and in Europe it progressed rapidly starting in the 1950s. Interconnections still limit the overall magnitude of the trade but since 2009 France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Germany have a fully integrated electricity market, with other EU partners expected to join soon. In North America the trade took off with the completion of HV direct current lines carrying Canadian hydroelectricity to U.S. markets. Because in 2005 the global electricity trade amounted to about 3.5% of all generation, there is a great potential for further growth in trade."}
{"text": "More than 500 hydro stations were completed before World War I, all but a few of them being low-capacity stations for local supply. The world’s ﬁrst giant hydro stations were built as a result of deliberate state support in the United States and in the USSR during the 1930s. The largest U.S. projects included a multi-station development directed by the Tennessee Valley Authority (a total of 29 dams) and the two dams of unprecedented size on the Colorado (Hoover Dam) and the Columbia (Grand Coulee). But the most intensive period of large-scale hydro construction came only after World War II: Between 1945 and 2000 more than 150 hydro stations with capacities greater than 1 GW were completed in more than 30 countries (ICOLD, 1998)."}
{"text": "industry had to deal with constantly changing safety regulations, construction delays, and falling electricity demand. As a result, a typical U.S. nuclear plant was completed only after great delays and at a much higher cost than originally anticipated, and new orders began to decline. And although an accident at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in March 1979 did not leak any radiation outside the containment structure, no new nuclear plants were ordered in the United States during the remainder of the twentieth century."}
{"text": "The United Kingdom continued with a scaled-down expansion, the USSR and Japan became other major builders, but France embarked on the boldest national nuclear program. Its core was a U.S. (Westinghouse pressurized water) reactor but its execution rested on building a large series of standardized plants (59, distributed around the country) and getting the beneﬁts of cumulative expe- rience and economies of scale. As a result, no other major economy was able to derive as much electricity from nuclear ﬁssion as France (recently about 78%). New capacities (almost solely in Asia) brought the total power installed in nearly 450 reactors to about 370 GWh in 2005 and increasing load factors (for the best stations more than 90%) raised the aggregate generation to just over 2.6 PWh. Besides France, the countries with the highest nuclear electricity share (setting aside Lithuania, which inherited a large Soviet nuclear plant at Ingalina that gave it a 70% nuclear share) are Belgium and the Slovak Republic (about 55%), Sweden (about 45%), and Switzerland (about 40%); Japan’s share was 29%, the United States’ 19%, Russia’s 16%, India’s 3%, and China’s 2% (IAEA, 2009)."}
{"text": "Before the recent rapid expansion of wind-generated electricity all other forms of primary electricity production were minor. The ﬁrst geothermal devel- opments date to the beginning of the twentieth century with Italy’s Larderello plant in 1902. The ﬁrst U.S. step toward commercializing geothermal genera- tion was taken in 1960 with the Geysers plant north of San Francisco (now with rated capacity of 35 MW) while New Zealand’s Wairakei came online in 1958 and Mexico’s Cerro Prieto in 1970. All of these pioneering projects are based in high-temperature vapor ﬁelds. Subsequent developments have added stations of mostly small to medium size in the four countries as well as in the Philippines, Indonesia, and China."}
{"text": "France’s La Rance (with 240 MW capacity, completed in 1966) remained the twentieth century’s only small commercial tidal power plant, and designs for wave- and ocean current-driven plants did not progress beyond theoretical proposals and a few small, temporary demonstration devices. And before 2000 neither wind generation nor PV conversion made any global difference, and even in the nations that led their development their contribution remained well below 1% of the total electricity supply. Installed capacity of wind turbines reached 18 GW in 2000, no more than 2% of the global total, but given the low average load factor (on the order of 20–25%), wind-powered generation remained below 1% of the world total. And PV remained completely marginal, with peak capacity of just over 1 GW by 2000."}
{"text": "Human muscles were the sole prime mover during the hominin evolution as well as in all preagricultural societies organized to provide subsistence through foraging (gathering and hunting). Human exertions are limited by metabolic rates and by mechanical properties of human bodies, and before the domestica- tion of draft animals the only way to enlarge their overall scope was to rely on combined action of people pushing or pulling heavy loads, sometimes with ingenious assistance by rolling logs or sleds (Smil, 1994). This is how Stonehenge, the great Egyptian pyramids, and the megalithic structures of Normandy, the Andean highlands, and Easter Island were built—but this multiplication of forces runs into obvious logistic constraints: The shape of a heavy object limits the number of people that can join to lift it, push it, or carry it, making those ancient construction feats even more remarkable."}
{"text": "Hand-made tools, ranging from simple wooden digging sticks to precisely ﬁn- ished stone arrowheads and bone needles, helped to improve the delivery of human power and mechanical devices—mostly variations of the three simplest designs (levers, inclined planes, and pulleys)—helped to expand its scope, but their sizes also had physical limits that were ultimately dictated by human metabolism and body structure. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) of all large mammals is a nonlinear function of their body mass M: When expressed in watts it equals 3.4M0.75 (Smil, 2008). This yields 70–90 W for most adult males and 55–75 W for females. Energy costs of physical exertion are expressed as multiples ofthe BMR: Light work requires up to 2.5 BMR, moderate tasks up to 5 BMR, and heavy exertions need as much as 7 BMR or in excess of 300 W for women and 500 W for men."}
{"text": "With the domestication of draft animals humans acquired more powerful prime movers, but because of the limits imposed by their body sizes and com- monly inadequate feeding the working bovines, equids, and camelids were used to perform only mostly the most demanding tasks (plowing, harrowing, pulling heavy cart- or wagon-loads or pulling out stumps, lifting water from deep wells) and most of the labor in traditional societies still needed human exertion. Because draft animals have different weights (primary determinants of overall draft power), anatomies, metabolic efﬁciencies and endurances, and because their potential power can be used to the best possible effect only with proper har- nessing and well-designed tools, it is impossible to offer any simple conclusions regarding the substitution of human labor by animal work."}
{"text": "Working bovines (many cattle breeds and water buffaloes) weigh from just 250 kg to more than 500 kg. With the exception of donkeys and ponies, working equines are more powerful: Larger mules and horses can deliver 500–800 W com- pared to 250–500 W for oxen. Some desert societies also used draft camels, elephants performed hard forest work in the tropics, and yaks, reindeer, and llamas were important pack animals. At the bottom of the scale were harnessed dogs and goats. Comparison of plowing productivities conveys the relative power of ani- mate prime movers. Even in the light soil it would take a steadily working peasant about 100 hours of hoeing to prepare a hectare of land for planting; in heavier soils it could be easily 150 hours. In contrast, a plowman guiding a medium-sized ox harnessed inefﬁciently by a simple wooden yoke and pulling a primitive wooden plow would do that work in less than 40 hours; a pair of good horses with collar harness and a steel plough would manage in just three hours."}
{"text": "Arable farming relying solely on human labor was thus suited only for garden- sized or small-ﬁeld cultivation and only the use of draft animals made it possible to cultivate larger ﬁelds. But their effective use required adequate feeding and efﬁ- cient harnessing, and their satisfactory combination became widespread only during the early modern era. The ability of bovines to survive solely on cellulosic feed (grasses or crop residues they can digest thanks to their microbial symbionts) made them the least demanding and the least expensive draft animals—but com- monly inadequate nutrition and hence low body weight, limited endurance, slow pace of work, and ineffective harnessing (by a variety of head and neck yokes) restricted their draft power to mostly less than 400–500 W per animal. During the nineteenth century the European farmers could do 25–30% more work in a day with a pair of horses than with a team of four oxen—and horses could work for up to 20 years, while oxen lasted normally for less than 10."}
{"text": "Comparing the performance of wheeled transport is obviously heavily inﬂu- enced by the quality of roads and the design of wheels and wagons: No draft ani- mal could make good progress on soft muddy or sandy roads, even less so when pulling heavy carts with massive wooden (initially full disk; spokes came around 2000 BCE in Egypt) wheels. When expressed in terms of daily mass-distance (t-km), a man pushing a wheelbarrow rated just around 0.5 t-km (less than 50-kg load transported 10–15 km), a pair of small oxen could reach 4–5 t-km (10 times the load at a similarly slow speed), and a pair of well-fed and well-harnessed nineteenth-century horses on a hard-top road could surpass 25 t-km."}
{"text": "All animate prime movers have very limited unit capacities, very high mass/ power ratios, and speciﬁc demands to support their best performance. Humans can sustain hours of useful work at 50–100 W, lighter and poorly harnessed draft animals can deliver 200–500 W, and even the most powerful horses can work steadily at no more than about 800–900 W. Higher output requires combining forces, a precept that all preindustrial cultures followed during the construction of their massive stone monuments. Domenico Fontana’s erection of an Egyptian obelisk (originally brought to Rome during Caligula’s reign) in St. Peter’s Square in 1586 is an outstanding illustration: 140 horses and 900 men were needed for the job (Fontana, 1590). And before the introduction of internal combustion engines the world’s ﬁrst combines in California and Washington were pulled by more than 30 horses."}
{"text": "Mass/power ratio is a critical characteristic of prime movers because it allows for universal comparisons across the entire evolutionary span; obviously, the lower the ratio the more powerful the prime mover. Commonalities of mamma- lian metabolism make the mass/power ratio for working humans and animals very similar, at nearly 1,000 g/W. An 80-kg man (BMR of 90 W) engaged in moderately heavy work (up to 5 times BMR, or 450 W) with typical chemical/ mechanical efﬁciency of 0.2 will produce 90 W and require nearly 900 g/W; a large horse (750 kg) working exactly at the rate of one horsepower (745.7 W) will have mass/power ratio of just over 1,000 W/g."}
{"text": "The ﬁrst stationary inanimate prime movers came into use long after the ﬁrst use of sails—but we cannot conclusively date the origins of the ﬁrst such device, a simple horizontal water wheel rotating around a sturdy wooden vertical shaft and directly driving an attached millstone. Lewis (1997) put its invention as early as the third century BCE (perhaps in Alexandria) but its ﬁrst surviving description comes from the ﬁrst century BCE (Antipater of Thessalonica), and by 27 BCE Vitruvius was describing more efﬁcient vertical wheels (rotating around a horizontal shaft), turning the millstones by right-angle gears and pow- ered by water impacting at their bottom (undershots), just above their midline (breastwheels), or falling from above in the most efﬁcient overshots. These wheels became relatively common in some parts of the Roman world already by the sec- ond century CE (Wikander, 1983), their numbers kept increasing during the sub- sequent centuries, and the Domesday book (a remarkable inventory of England’s economic capacities in 1086) listed about 6,500 of these machines used to do many other tasks besides milling grain (Holt, 1988)."}
{"text": "The origin of windmills, the second most important preindustrial mechanical prime movers, is even more obscure than is the emergence of water wheels (Lewis, 1993). What we know with certainty is that the ﬁrst devices—crudely made, very inefﬁcient, with cloth sails mounted on vertical wooden axes turning millstones without any gearing—were used in Sistn (in today’s eastern Iran) and that their subsequent westward diffusion, beginning during the eleventh century, brought them to Byzantine lands and from there the Crusaders introduced them to Atlantic Europe. During the Middle Ages Europe’s lands bordering the Atlantic acquired the world’s largest concentration of windmills and retained this primacy until the advent of the nineteenth-century industrialization."}
{"text": "Useful power of common medieval windmills was certainly lower than the power of typical contemporary water wheels, but the ﬁrst reliable measurements of windmill performance were done only during the 1750s. At that time John Smeaton found a common Dutch mill (with 9-m sails) as powerful as 10 men or 2 horses, that is, conservatively converted, with capacity of about 1 kW (Smeaton, 1796). Larger mills could have wind-shaft power well in excess of 10 kW (a pre- served 1648 marsh mill was appraised at about 30 kW) but large gearing losses (on the order of 50–60%) reduced the useful power considerably."}
{"text": "Typical useful power ratings were less than 1 kW for the American Great Plains wheels, 1–2 kW for small and 2–5 kW for large medieval European post mills, 4–8 kW for widely used early modern European tower mills, and 8–12 kW for the largest nineteenth-century devices in countries around the North Sea. By 1900 the total number of windmills in that region was in the tens of thousands and de Zeeuw (1978) estimated their aggregate power at no less than 100 MW. For comparison, during the second half of the nineteenth century sales of smaller American windmills reached several million units and their aggregate capacity in 1900 was estimated at about 90 MW by the U.S. Bureau of Census (1975)— but it was put at nearly 500 MW by Daugherty (1927)."}
{"text": "The ﬁrst commercial steam engines fueled by coal and designed by Thomas Newcomen (1663–1729) during the ﬁrst decade of the eighteenth century were so inefﬁcient that they could operate proﬁtably only in coal mines, mostly for pumping water from pits (Rolt & Allen, 1977). Because the engine’s piston was cooled with every stroke (condensation of steam took place on its underside), New- comen’s machine converted no more than 0.5% of coal’s chemical energy into slow reciprocating motion. James Watt’s (1736–1819) famous improvements, patented in 1769, included a separate steam condenser, an insulated steam jacket around the cylinder, and an air pump to maintain vacuum (Robinson & Musson, 1969). Watt also designed a double-acting engine (with piston driving also on the down stroke) and a centrifugal governor to maintain constant speed with varying loads."}
{"text": "And the just cited maximum of more than 20% applied only to massive stationary triple- and quadruple-expansion engines; smaller shipborne engines were about 10% and locomotive engines only 6–8% efﬁcient. Not surprisingly, once a better alternative became available steam engines retreated fairly rapidly: Already by 1900 it was clear that they were an inferior choice as the prime movers for thermal electricity generation when compared to steam turbines; a few years later mass production of reliable gasoline engines ended a brief era of steam- powered automobiles (Ford’s famous Model Twas introduced in 1908); and before the beginning of World War I it was clear that it was only a matter of time before diesel engines would displace steam engines in shipping and on railroads."}
{"text": "This is an apposite place to describe in some detail the key beneﬁts of electric motors, whose rapid diffusion was made possible by solving the key challenges of large-scale electricity generation and transmission during the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Long before these converters revolutionized household work they brought an even more fundamental change to industrial production in general and to labor-intensive manufacturing in particular. The steam engine, the ﬁrst widely used coal-powered prime mover, did not change the way mechani- cal energy was distributed in factories that used to rely on power produced by water wheels: ceilings in textile or machining plants remained full of long line shafts whose rotations were transmitted (usually by belts) to machines on the fac- tory ﬂoor. This was expensive, awkward, dangerous, and inconvenient, as acciden- tal damage to any part of the system forced its complete closure while even a partial production capacity required the entire system to operate."}
{"text": "Electric motors eliminated the need for converting reciprocating power delivered by steam engines into rotary motion by using line shafts and long ceiling-to-ﬂoor belts. No less importantly, they allowed precise, on-demand, convenient power supply to individual machines on the factory ﬂoor while free- ing the ceilings for allowing adequate natural or electric lighting (Schurr, 1984). They also eliminated another disadvantage shared by steam and internal com- bustion engines, constant vibration. Electriﬁcation of industrial manufacturing was completed ﬁrst in the United States (during the 1930s), then in Europe (by the 1950s), and many low-income countries went straight from the ancient use of animate prime movers to reliance on electric motors: Irrigation powered by an electric pump as opposed to by animals lifting water from a well is just one of many examples of this transition."}
{"text": "Electric motors have powered yet another important energy transition, from steam to electricity on railroads. In freight transport steam was displaced pri- marily by heavy diesel engines (this transition was complete in North America and most of Europe by the late 1950s), but all of the world’s fast trains are now powered by electricity. This trend began in 1964 with Japan’s Tkaid shinkansen and in 1981 France was the ﬁrst European country to introduce comparably fast (and eventually even faster) service with its TGV (Train Grande Vitesse) trains, whose variants now operate also across the Channel and in the United Kingdom (Eurostar), in Belgium (Thalys), Spain (AVE), and in Germany (InterCity)."}
{"text": "The ﬁrst four-stroke compression engine had efﬁciency of about 17% and mass/power ratio of just 250 g/W, much lower than that of any similarly sized contemporary steam engine. Otto’s company eventually produced nearly 50,000 of these gas-fueled machines with the most common ratings between 5 and 10 kW and with aggregate capacity of about 150 MW. The next advance was to design a four-stroke compression engine running on gasoline, a fuel whose energy density is roughly 1,600 times that of the coal gas used in Otto engines and whose low ﬂashpoint makes engine starting easy."}
{"text": "375 kW for the Hummer,their compression ratios are typically between 9:1 and 12:1 and their mass/power ratios are mostly between 0.8 and 1.2 g/W.But even the most powerful gasoline-fueled engines (in excess of 500kW)are too smallto propel massive ocean-going vessels or to be used by the largest road trucks and off-road vehicles or as electricity generators in emergencies or in isolated locations."}
{"text": "Those duties are filled by another internal combustion engine,one that ini- tiates combustion through high compression and hence is inherently more effi- cient.Rudolf Diesel laid the conceptual foundation of this engine during the early 1890s and then,with support and cooperation of Heinrich von Buz,general director of the Maschinenfabrik Augsburg,he developed the first practical engine by 1897.Its official testing showed power of 13.5kWand a high mass/power ratio of 333g/W—but with thermal efficiency of nearly 35%and mechanical efficiency of about 75%its net efficiency was just over 26%,a performance superior to any contemporary converter of fuel to mechanical energy(Diesel,1913)."}
{"text": "The only new prime mover introduced during the twentieth century was the gas turbine, a machine whose concept goes back to the last decade of the eighteenth century but whose ﬁrst successful prototypes were built during the late 1930s. World War II accelerated the development of jet engines and the British industries tried to capitalize on Frank Whittle’s (and Frank Halford’s) pioneering designs by launching the ﬁrst programs to develop jet-powered passenger planes. Geoffrey de Havilland began to develop Comet, the ﬁrst commercial jetliner powered by de Havilland’s Ghost turbojet, for the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) in 1946. The plane entered service on May 2, 1952 but the entire Comet ﬂeet was grounded in 1954 after several fatal accidents caused by catastrophic decompression of the plane’s fuselage."}
{"text": "As a result Boeing’s 707, with four Pratt & Whitney’s 84-kN JT3D engines, became the most successful pioneering jetliner design in 1958, and the company strengthened its primacy with the introduction of the ﬁrst wide-body plane, Boeing 747, with four Pratt & Whitney’s 210-kN JTD engines, in 1969. Eventually only two companies, America’s Boeing and the European Airbus, survived the compe- tition to produce all of the world’s large commercial jetliners, and all of their planes are powered by gas turbines made by one of the three remaining makers of jet engines, America’s GE and Pratt & Whitney and British Rolls-Royce, or their consortia. Advances in the performance of jet engines are best illustrated by contrasting the performance of the ﬁrst commercial designs (turbojets) with the latest turbines (all turbofans)."}
{"text": "Development of larger stationary gas turbines—used primarily for electricity generation during peak demand hours as well as to power industrial compressors— had proceeded in parallel with the introduction of more powerful jet engines. The largest gas turbines used to generate electricity reached the capacity of 100 MW in 1976 (with about 32% efﬁciency) and by 2008 the most powerful unit was a Siemens turbine rated at 340 MW (Siemens, 2009). Such turbines do not work alone: Their waste heat is used by attached steam turbines and the resulting combined-cycle arrangements have net efﬁciencies as high as 60%. In addition to these large machines, smaller aeroderivative turbines (essentially grounded jets) have become increasingly popular since the 1980s thanks to their ﬂexibility and rapid installation."}
{"text": "As with so many other technical advances, long-term comparisons of prime movers show some astounding gains since the invention and perfection of fossil-fueled prime movers. Until about 10,000 years ago the peak performances were limited by the power of human muscles, affording short-term maxima of 100–200 W of useful work, and sustained exertion at 50–100 W. Domestication of draft animals increased sustained work rates to mostly 300–500 W in antiquity (limits imposed by the animal size, feeding, and harness) and to 400–800 W after 1800, when the brief exertions of heavy draft horses could deliver more than 2 kW/animal. Maximum sustained performance of the most powerful animate prime movers thus rose by an order of magnitude, from about 60–80 W for women and men to 600–800 W (average for good horses)."}
{"text": "Power of water wheels, the ﬁrst inanimate prime movers, rose slowly from small machines of the late antiquity capable of just 102 W to larger wheels with power of a few kW (103 W) after 1700 and to as much as a few hundred kW (105 W) by 1850; windmills, whose adoption came more than a millennium after the ﬁrst conversions of ﬂowing water, also had a slow capacity growth culminating in machines of no more than 104 W by the late nineteenth century. Capacities of water wheels, the largest preindustrial inanimate prime movers, thus rose by three orders of magnitude (thousand-fold), but it took them about two millennia to do so. In contrast, capacities of steam engines, the ﬁrst postindustrial inanimate prime movers, grew exponentially: They surpassed those of the largest water wheels in less than halfa century after their commercial introduction in the early eighteenth century; by 1850 the unit maxima were above 105 W and by 1900 they exceeded 1 MW (106 W)."}
{"text": "Naturally, this continuity applies also to the now unfolding transition from fossil fuel to the conversion of renewable energies. Perhaps most notably, wind turbines are now seen as great harbingers of renewability, about to sever our dependence on fossil fuels. But their steel towers are made from the metal smelted with coal-derived coke or from recycled steel made in arc furnaces, and both pro- cesses are energized by electricity generated largely by turbogenerators powered by coal and natural gas combustion. And their giant blades are made from plastics synthesized from hydrocarbon feedstocks that are derived from crude oil whose extraction remains unthinkable without powerful diesel, or diesel-electric, engines."}
{"text": "QUANTIFYING THE TRANSITIONS: UNCERTAINTIES AND TRENDS\n\nQuantifying the global preindustrial consumption of biofuels can be done with conﬁdence only as far as the absolute magnitude is concerned. At the begin- ning of the nineteenth century the total was at least 20 EJ (in terms of air-dry bio- mass containing 10–15% moisture) and it is unlikely that by the year 2000 it rose above 50 EJ/year. But because most of the fuelwood used in low-income countries is never traded but collected by women and children for their family use, and because the share of crop residues used for fuel is even more difﬁcult to quantify, we cannot be certain if, as FAO (1999) estimated for the late 1990s, 63% of all harvested wood was burned as fuel or if the share amounted to just 55% or 70%, or if the burning of crop residues in the ﬁeld, their recycling, and feeding to animals left just 20% or as much as 30% of their total mass for fuel. The differ- ence between the lower and upper estimates adds up to about 10 EJ for the year 2000 (20% of the likely maximum), and the relative uncertainties are even greater for earlier periods."}
{"text": "The simplest estimates of the past biomass energy use thus multiply the best available approximations of population totals by the most plausible annual per capita consumption rates. I have used continental disaggregations for both the population totals and time-differentiated (1800, 1850, and 1900) per capita consumption means (ranging from the lows of 10 GJ in Africa for all periods to the high of 90 GJ in North America in 1850 and 30 GJ/capita in 1900) to esti- mate the global biomass energy use during the nineteenth century. These calcula- tions produce approximate totals of 20 EJ of biomass energy in 1800, about 25 EJ in 1850, and 22 EJ in 1900. My most likely range for the year 2000 is 40–45 EJ, the higher total corresponding to the mean (45 ± 10 EJ) offered by Turkenburg et al. (2000). These totals imply a doubling of biofuel harvests during the twenti- eth century, and this absolute growth has been accompanied by declining per capita uses everywhere except in the sub-Saharan Africa."}
{"text": "Comparing the spans of individual energy transitions cannot be done without deﬁning their onsets and progressive milestones. Given the antiquity of coal’s small-scale localized extraction it is particularly necessary to impose a meaning- ful threshold to begin that particular count. Choosing 5% of the total global fuel supply as the beginning of a transition period would mean that the transition from biofuels to coal got underway by about 1840. The ﬁrst conclusion of this global quantiﬁcation is that the relative importance of biofuels had not changed dramatically during the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century (it was still nearly 95% of the fuel total by 1840) but it began its accelerated decline after 1850: By 1860 the share of biomass fuels fell below 85%, by 1880 it was just above 70%, by 1890 it was less than two thirds, and although we will never be able to pinpoint the date, it is most likely that sometime during the latter half of the 1890s fossil fuels (i.e., overwhelmingly, coal) began to supply more than half of all energy derived from the combustion of fuels."}
{"text": "4 YJ. This means that even when using the total energy content of globally pro- duced crude oil (including all non-energy applications) coal would either just edge out liquid hydrocarbons or, allowing for the inherent uncertainties in con- verting coal to common energy equivalents, the twentieth-century’s cumulative extraction of the two fuels would be basically equal."}
{"text": "As already explained, when comparing the progress of individual energy transi- tions I begin the count once a fuel or a prime mover had surpassed a marginal share of an overall market and reached 5% of the total production or capacity, and I then trace approximate time spans needed to reach major milestones. For the fuels these are reaching 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 33%, and 40% of the overall supply in energy terms. Comparing the time spans for the three successive fuel transitions reveals some remarkable similarities. Coal replacing biofuels reached the 5% mark around 1840, it captured 10% of the global market by 1855, 15% by 1865, 20% by 1870, 25% by 1875, 33% by 1885, 40% by 1895 and 50% by 1900. The sequence of years for these milestones was thus 15–25–30–35–45–55–60."}
{"text": "From a purely statistical point of view a set ofa mere three sequences does not provide any foundation for conclusive generalizations about the tempo of global energy transitions—but, at the same time, a remarkable similarity of the three outcomes cannot be dismissed as a mere coincidence, particularly given the fact that the substitutions have involved three very different kinds of fuels that serve identical, or similar, ﬁnal consumption niches but whose extraction, distribu- tion, and conversion require very different techniques and infrastructures. And no less signiﬁcant is a clear absence of any indication suggesting an accelerating progress of later transitions: If anything, natural gas has had a more difﬁcult time of reaching the milestones previously claimed by both solid and liquid fossil fuels. At the same time, it is also necessary to take into account the absolute quantities involved: As the global fuel production increases, it is more challenging to replicate the same relative rise in absolute energy terms."}
{"text": "66 ENERGY TRANSITIONS\n\nAs coal extraction rose from 5% to 25% of all fuels (between 1840 and the late 1870s), that increase required adding on the order of 250 Mt of coal, or less than 7 EJ of energy; the same increase of the total fuel market share for crude oil (between 1910 and 1945) called for adding extraction of some 300 Mt of oil, or about 11 EJ of energy, while the ascent of natural gas from 5% to 25% of global fuel production took place mostly during the rapid post–WWII expansion of global energy demand (between 1940 and 1990) and it entailed adding more than 70 EJ of energy, an order of magnitude more than during coal’s rise a century earlier. Vastly increased absolute size of today’s energy demand means that—even with considerably greater technical and organizational means at our disposal and even in the cases where resource availability is not a constraint—it is much more challenging to develop a new source of primary energy supply to the point where it can start making a real difference (10–15% of the total market) and then carry on to elevate it to a truly major role."}
{"text": "An obvious question to ask is: ‘‘Would a clever statistical analysis reveal some deﬁnite, generally applicable, rules or patterns governing the transition process?’’ During the late 1970s, as a part of his research at IIASA, Cesare Marchetti, asking this very question, looked for a general model describing primary energy substitu- tions and he found it by applying the Fisher-Pry model (Fisher & Pry, 1971) to the market shares of successively introduced fuels or primary forms of electricity. The model was originally developed to study the market penetration of new tech- niques and it assumes that many technical advances are essentially competitive substitutions, that once they capture at least a few percent of their respective mar- kets they will proceed to completion and that the rate of fractional substitution is proportional to the remainder that is yet to be substituted."}
{"text": "Marchetti(1977,p.348)chose to interpret his plots in the most enthusiastic fashion,claiming that\"The whole destiny of an energy source seems to be com- pletely predetermined in the first childhood...these trends….go unscathed through wars,wild oscillations in energy prices and depressions Final total availabil- ity of the primary reserves also seems to have no effect on the rate of substitution.\" Two years later,in a longer report,he marveled how the penetration rates remained constant during the first three quarters of the twentieth century despite such major perturbations as wars and periods of both economic stagnation and rapid growth. This led him to condlude that\"it is as though the system hada schedule,a will and a clock\"and that it is capable of reabsorbing all perturbations\"elastically without infuencing the trend\"(Marchetti &Nakicenovic,1979,p.15)."}
{"text": "In contrast, Marchetti’s reliance on highly incorrect (indefensibly low) esti- mates of global fuelwood consumption led him to conclude that the worldwide combustion of wood will decline to less than 1% of the total primary energy supply before the mid-1990s. In reality, in 2000 traditional biofuels (leaving aside crop-derived ethanol and biodiesel) supplied at least 10% (and most likely close to 12%) of the world’s primary energy, and by 2010 their share was still no less than 8–9%, that is, still more than energy supplied by nuclear electricity gen- eration (but I hasten to add that this comparison is correct only in gross energy terms; in terms of useful energy, nuclear electricity was ahead, as its conversion efﬁciencies are obviously superior to those of burning biomass)."}
{"text": "Most importantly, Marchetti’s application of the substitution model to energy transitions replicates well only two major realities: the slow ascent of coal, the fuel’s relative peak and pre-1970 decline; and crude oil’s pre-1970 rise to become the most important fossil fuel. Everything else has been a failure. Most notably, that overly mechanistic/deterministic application was quite incapable of captur- ing the post-1970 departures from the expected tracks when the trend for coal and oil was mostly sideways rather than down, when natural gas continued to gain at a considerably slower pace than expected, and when nuclear electricity came close to the anticipated share by an entirely unforeseen route (see ﬁg. 2.12)."}
{"text": "The two rounds of OPEC’s large price rises (1973–1974 and 1979–1981) triggered these shifts, but other factors contributed as the newly set trends per- severed during the periods of both very high and very low oil prices. The two price rises, coming after generations of very cheap oil, slowed down the growth of global energy demand and stopped the growth of oil production for 15 years (1979–1994). But once the global oil consumption reached its relative peak (at about 46% in 1979), its subsequent decline was much slower than the retreat that was to be expected as a mirror image of its pre-1979 ascent. At the same time, the post-1975 natural gas extraction had also slowed down while coal pro- duction continued to grow more vigorously than expected. As a result, by the late 1980s, just a decade after Marchetti began to promote his deterministic model, his prediction of oil and coal shares in global energy consumption was signiﬁcantly below their actual levels."}
{"text": "Prime mover transitions are much harder to quantify and the transition from animate labor to water wheels, windmills, and steam engines presents a particu- larly great challenge. The main reason is the absence of reliable basic statistics that makes it necessary to resort to cumulative assumptions. Available estimates of global population totals differ by nearly 40% even for the year 1800 and the disparity is still almost 15% for 1900 (USCB, 2009). Child labor was common in all preindustrial societies as well as during the early periods of industrialization and this reality affects the estimates of economically active population. Long labor days were common in all traditional agricultures during planting, transplanting, and harvesting, but relatively long periods of low activity followed during post- harvest season. This reality complicates the estimates of typical labor burden. And highly approximate assumptions must be made regarding the average power of useful labor that depended not only on gender and age but also on nutrition and overall health."}
{"text": "But the need for multiple assumptions does not prevent us from arriving at correct order-of-magnitude quantities even for the societies where there is virtually no reliable statistical information. I have calculated the maximum conceivable share of water power during the late Roman Empire by assuming high numbers of working water wheels (about 25,000 mills), very high average power per machine (1.5 kW), and a high load factor of 50% (Smil, 2010a). These assump- tions result in some 300 TJ of useful work while the labor of some 25 million adults (at 60 W for 300 eight-hour days) and 6 million animals (at just 300 W/head for 200 eight-hour days) added up to 30 PJ a year, or at least 100 times as much useful energy per year as the work done by water wheels. Consequently, even with very liberal assumptions water power in the late Roman Empire supplied no more than 1% of all useful energy provided by animate exertion—and the real share was most likely just a fraction of 1%."}
{"text": "On the global scale the inanimate prime movers (except for sails, whose over- all energy contribution is hard to quantify) were thus, at best, marginal sources of power during antiquity, and the situation did not change substantially until the nineteenth century. My approximate calculations indicate that by 1850 draft animals supplied roughly half of all useful work, human labor provided as much as 40%, and inanimate prime movers delivered between 10% and 15%. By 1900 inanimate prime movers (dominated by steam engines, with water turbines in the second place) contributed 45%–50%, animal labor provided about a third, and human labor no more than a ﬁfth of the total. By 1950 human labor, although in absolute terms more important than ever, was a marginal contribu- tor (maximum of about 5%), animal work was down to about 10%, and inani- mate prime movers (dominated by internal combustion engines and steam and water turbines) contributed at least 85%, and very likely 90%, of all useful work."}
{"text": "This indicates a fairly orderly transition on the global scale, with inanimate prime movers increasing their share of useful work by nearly 10% a decade between 1850 and 1950. After they reached 10% share in 1850 it took them 30 years to go to 25%, then about 20 years to provide half of the total, 30 years to get to 75%, and some 20 years to supply 90% of all useful work. If these esti- mates are used in a standard binary Fisher-Pry substitution model of inanimate prime movers displacing animate work there is an excellent ﬁt for nearly 150 years beginning in 1850: Only the most recent reality departs (although not dramatically) from the model’s expectations, as animate labor still provided at least 4–6% of all useful energy in 2000 rather than a maximum of 2% indi- cated by the f/(1-f) trend."}
{"text": "In the absence of even approximate information regarding the total capacities of water wheels and windmills in eighteenth-century Europe, the Americas, and Asia, as well as the total capacities and load factors of early steam engines work- ing on those continents, it is impossible to pinpoint the time when the contribu- tion of steam engines surpassed the useful work of the two long-established inanimate prime movers: The most likely decade was the 1830s. Steam engines were the world’s sole fuel-converting commercially deployed inanimate prime mover for 150 years, between the 1710s and 1860s (when Otto began selling his stationary horizontal internal combustion engines) and they remained the world’s leading mechanical prime mover for nearly a century. By 1930 they still powered nearly all trains and more than 80% of all ships and supplied most power in industrial enterprises, but they were already gone from electricity gen- eration. And although steam engines were deployed in ﬁeld work (above all in heavy plowing), agricultural transition from animate to inanimate prime movers took off only after 1900."}
{"text": "Perhaps nothing illustrates better the gradual process of agricultural mechani- zation than the fact that in the year 2000 low-income countries, with some 80% of the world’s population, had less than 30% of the world’s 27 million tractors (compared to nearly 20% in the United States alone) and, given much larger capacities of U.S. machines (the largest ones now rate in excess of 300 kW, i.e., more than 400 hp), an even lower share of total tractor power. My approximate cal- culations show that even in 1950 the useful work done by the world’s 400 million draft animals and by tractors were roughly equal, and that in the year 2000 ﬁeld and transport service provided by some 500 million animals still supplied perhaps as much as 20% of all (excluding human) agricultural labor. But a transition within this transition, from gasoline-powered to predominantly diesel-powered tractors, was fairly rapid: Diesel tractors were introduced in the early 1930s and by the 1960s all more powerful machines were diesel-powered; small tractors, including the hand-guided two-wheelers (rotary tillers) used in the monsoonal Asia remained powered by gasoline."}
{"text": "There is no simple way to quantify the transition to mobile (automotive and truck) internal combustion engines because these vehicles displaced a variety of transportation modes (ranging from porters to canal barges) and specialized conveyances, some powered by human and animal muscles (litters and wheelbar- rows, carts and wagons), others by wind (sail ships) and steam (steam ships and trains). Moreover, car ownership did not necessarily eliminate all of the previous uses: In many countries (most notably in Japan and in many EU nations) high levels of car ownership coexist with a widespread use of public transport."}
{"text": "But we can time three important shifts away from steam engines: to steam turbines in thermal electricity generation, to diesel engines in shipping, and also to diesel engines on railroads. The ﬁrst transition was a rapid one because the turbines were accepted as a superior choice in less than two decades after their introduction. The last major U.S. coal-ﬁred station with steam engines (16 massive Westinghouse-Corliss machines) was New York Edison’s East River in 1902, the last British installation of that kind was London’s County Council Tramway power station in Greenwich completed in 1905 (Dickinson, 1939)."}
{"text": "Conquest of marine shipping by diesels can be dated precisely, from Selandia in 1911 to the Liberty ships of World War II whose production ended in 1945: Many steam engines continued to work well into the 1950s, but by that time all new large ships were diesel-powered. Prime mover transition on railroads was not that straightforward: Diesel locomotives began to be introduced in both Western Europe and the United States during the late 1920s. In the United States they captured half of the market by 1952 and accounted for 90% of all locomotives by 1957; a Fisher-Pry plot shows slightly bent lines because of a rel- atively slower substitution progress during the war and a very rapid rate of change after 1950 (Sharif & Kabir, 1976). Except for a few isolated cases steam locomo- tives were gone from the U.S. railroads by 1960 and in Western Europe about a decade later (only in China and India many of them served into the 1990s)— but unlike in the United States, some countries (Japan, France, Germany, Russia) electriﬁed most of their tracks and hence both their fast passenger trains and heavy freight trains are powered by electric motors."}
{"text": "This means that large marine diesels needed about 40 years to move from pioneering designs to a near-complete dominance of that important transport niche. Similarly, where the transition on railroads was solely, or largely, from steam to diesel engines, its duration was 35–45 years from the ﬁrst models to near- complete dominance. The fastest substitution of draft animals by tractors took place in the United States, with 30 years from the ﬁrst introduction (in the early 1890s) to more than 50% of total power (in the early 1920s), but another 30 years were needed to bring that share above 90%. In Western Europe the spans from introduction of tractors to their near-complete dominance were about 60 years and the transition has yet to be accomplished in many Asian and African countries."}
{"text": "Tracing these transitions will make it clear that the British experience was entirely sui generis (its lessons are quite different from the French or the Dutch process), and that the United States rose to afﬂuence along a trajectory that was very different from the European quest for high-energy modernized society. China’s belated quest for modernity has been energized by one of the world’s most idiosyncratic energy transitions, and Japan has the distinction of being the only one of the world’s ﬁve largest economies to be almost entirely dependent on energy imports. And as different as Russia and Saudi Arabia undoubtedly are, their energy transitions had shared some (and not necessarily desirable) traits."}
{"text": "NATIONAL TRANSITIONS: COMMONALITIES AND PARTICULARITIES 77\n\nThese eight case studies also cover a substantial (and hence highly representative) share of the current global economic power and energy use: Combined population of the examined nations is about 30% of the world total, but their aggregate eco- nomic product is now equal (in purchasing power parity terms) to 50% and their energy consumption adds up to 55% of the global total."}
{"text": "But this selection, as representative as it may be, begs at least two obvious questions. The ﬁrst one is why not to include Germany, a great pioneer of tech- nical advances in general and of energy innovations in particular, and the EU’s largest economy? And the second, why not India, the world’s second most popu- lous nation and now also the world’s fourth-largest (in terms of purchasing power parity) economy? The ﬁrst deliberate omission is largely due to statistical com- plications. There was no united Germany during the earliest stages of the grand energy transition of the seventeenth to the early nineteenth century, and the German Empire had different borders (and hence incomparable populations and GDP outputs) at the time of its establishment in 1871 (after the defeat of France and annexation of Alsace-Lorraine), in 1918 (after its defeat in World War I), in 1939 (after its annexation of Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, and a large part of Poland), in 1945 (after its defeat in World War II deprived it ofall territories east of the Oder), between 1945 and 1990 when it was divided into two countries, and after October 1990 (when the two states were reunited). Navigating through these shifts is a difﬁcult task even where the most basic statistics are concerned."}
{"text": "Territorial changes are not a problem in India’s case because the country’s epochal energy transition from biomass to fossil fuels got really underway only after the partition of British India and the creation of a new independent Indian state in 1947. I excluded the country from a more detailed historical examination not only because its transition to modern energies is of a relatively recent origin (with large parts of rural India perpetuating the traditional dependence on bio- mass fuels and animate labor for mechanical power)—but also because it shares a number of its basic features (very large rural sector, delayed urbanization, use of crop residues for fuel in extended arid and deforested areas, high dependence on coal, large hydropower potential, late onset of hydrocarbon imports) with the process that has been unfolding in China."}
{"text": "EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE: BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND THE NETHERLANDS\n\nWhy an offshore island country became the world’s ﬁrst society to undergo the process of industrialization energized primarily by coal has been one of the most fascinating, and most recurring, questions of historical analysis, and I have already referred (in the ﬁrst chapter) to some of the arguments advanced as explanations. This section’s modest aim is merely to quantify the process of this primordial English, Welsh, and Scottish biomass-to-coal transition, follow its consequences as Britain lived on an extended coal plateau for nearly three centu- ries, and then analyze those post–WWII developments that have profoundly changed the country’s energetic basis and hence its very economic foundations."}
{"text": "Tracing the earliest history of Britain’s energy transition from wood to coal is a task that has been made relatively easy thanks to several detailed and revealing inquiries into this subject, including Nef (1932), Flinn (1984), Mitchell (1984), and Fouquet (2008) . English coal—known and used sporadically in small manufactures for centuries—became an increasingly important heating fuel already during the ﬁrst half of the sixteenth century, above all (due to its falling prices) among poorer households. But even the late Elizabethan nobility still dis- dained the use of coal with its sulfurous smoke, and the regal example was needed to overcome that resistance as Elizabeth’s successor (James I, crowned in 1603) began to use coal in his London palace (Brimblecombe, 1987)."}
{"text": "Nor was coal’s use in industry a matter of enthusiastic adoption. As its price declined, coal began to be used ﬁrst in manufactures that required relatively low heat supply from below (smithing, brewing, dying, and production of salt, lime, and soap). After 1610 glassmakers began to switch to coal thanks to the introduc- tion of reverberating (heat-reﬂecting) furnaces that produced sufﬁciently high temperature. Because of a gradually rising demand, nearly all of the coalﬁelds that later made the country the world’s largest fuel producer (in the Northeast, Yorkshire, Midlands, Wales, Scotland) were opened for commercial exploitation before 1640, and fairly reliable data show annual extraction (no more than 25,000 t by 1600) surpassing 2 Mt by 1650 and reaching 3 Mt by 1700."}
{"text": "Inevitably,final coal uses had seen many shifts during this long period:First came the coal combustion as a direct source of thermal energy for household heating and in manufacturing;steam engines created a new market for coal as a source of mechanical energy for stationary industrial applications.Adoption of metallurgical coke introduced another powerful positive feedback:By 1780 coke price was down by two thirds compared to 1740 and coal use for coking rose from less than 3,000 tin 1750 to 170,000tby 1800(Harris,1988).The next important new market for coal was the production of town(coal)gas used forillu- mination.Coal consumption got its largest boost from the emergence of pressur- ized,and hence smaller and more efficient,mobile steam engines used after 1840 on large scales in railroad locomotives and in ship propulsion.Soon after a smaller new market emerged for non-energy uses of coal(specifically coal tar)as a feed- stock for syntheses of organic chemicals,but by far the most important (and enduring new final use of coal came during the 1880s with electricity generation British coal production reached its peak in 1913(with 287 Mt)and it was reduced less by World War I than by two general strikes in 1921 and 1926."}
{"text": "Social dislocations of this shift were profound: At the time of nationalization in 1947 the coal industry’s labor force totaled nearly 704,000 but in 1994, at the time of re-privatization, there were only about 25,000 employees (Hicks & Allen, 1999). But because the country’s electricity generation has remained highly depen- dent on coal, and because Britain’s remaining blast furnaces still needed coke, the shortfall in domestic production had to be made by increasing coal imports: In 2001 the UK’s coal imports surpassed domestic output as coals to Newcastle changed from a proverbial description of a superﬂuous activity to commercial reality."}
{"text": "Decline of British coal mining was accelerated by the discoveries of the North Sea hydrocarbons (ﬁrst natural gas in the West Sole ﬁeld in 1965, then crude oil in the giant Forbes ﬁeld in 1970) and by a temporary conversion of Britain into one of the world’s leading producers of oil and one of the largest users of natural gas. British geologists were among the pioneers of the global search for oil and British engineers developed some of the world’s earliest oilﬁelds, particularly in Burma, part of British India (Burmah Oil Company was set up in 1886) and in Persia where in 1908 William Knox D’Arcy drilled the ﬁrst Middle Eastern oilﬁeld at Masjid-e-Soleiman and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the precursor of British Petroleum, was setup a year later (Ferrier, 1982). The country was thus an early, and relatively substantial, importer of crude oil and, as already noted, Britain also pioneered LNG imports."}
{"text": "By 2010 France had 59 reactors that have been strategically distributed around the country: Massif Central and Midi-Pyrnes are the only regions without them. Their total capacity is about 63 GW but because they constitute such a large part of the total installed power (nearly 80%) they cannot be used (as is the norm elsewhere) only for the base load generation and must be operated in the much more challenging load-following mode (WNA, 2009). As a result their average load factor during the years 2006–2008 was only about 79% compared to more than 91% in the United States or South Korea. Even so, French reactors now generate more than 400 TWh a year, or 75–78% (depending on the contri- bution by hydro stations) of all electricity, a share not matched (not even approached) by any other major economy: In 2008 only three small countries, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Belgium, had shares in excess 50%, and the next highest share for a large economy was Japan’s with about 25% (IAEA, 2009)."}
{"text": "Exploitation of these resources resulted in a relatively high per capita use of inanimate energies, enabled an uncommon degree of urbanization (already more than 60% during the seventeenth century), powered the industrial development of the Dutch Golden Age, and provides the best explanation how a population of just 1.5 million people could ‘‘manage to play leading parts on almost every scene of human activities’’ (de Zeeuw, 1978, p. 3) and enjoy average annual energy con- sumption of at least 15 GJ/capita, that is, more in 1650 than India averaged in\n\n2000. Peat, the youngest fossil fuel, was the principal source of industrial and domestic heat, and, fortuitously, every one of Holland’s major cities had nearby resources that could be easily extracted and inexpensively transported. Peat’s annual consumption during the seventeenth century averaged about 1.5 Mt (equivalent of about 25 PJ or nearly 800 MW) but coal and ﬁrewood were also imported and Holland’s windy climate and ﬂat landscape provided excellent con- ditions for harnessing wind by sails and mills."}
{"text": "Assumptions and simpliﬁcations are needed to estimate the aggregate output of these two prime movers and hence de Zeeuw’s calculations (1978) must be seen only as revealing approximations. Some 3,000 windmills (with average power of 2.5 kW) generated less than 200 TJ (about 6 MW) and sailing ships contributed annually another 150 TJ (nearly 5 MW) of power. These are relatively small aggregates (each less than 1% of the peat’s energy content) but they resulted in large savings of human and animal labor and reduced the amount of land needed for the animal feeding: Replacing the windmills would have required at least 300,000 workers or some 50,000 horses and feeding those animals would have claimed a sixth of the country’s total area in addition to the existing crop ﬁelds. After the best peat deposits were depleted and shipping became more expensive due to extensive silting of shallow waterways and harbors, Holland ceased to be an exception and its energy use began to resemble that of the neigh- boring countries."}
{"text": "These exports’ earnings made it much easier to end all Dutch coal mining and to reorient Limburg’s industries. In December 1965 the government decided to phase out all of the coal mining in the Limburg province within 10 years, remov- ing the economic basis for more than 200,000 people in one of the most densely populated regions of the country and doing away with some 45,000 mining and 30,000 related jobs. Largely successful countermeasures included subsidies for new industries and relocation of some government ofﬁces from the capital and the Staatsmijnen (DSM after 1967) was given a share (40%) in the Groningen’s development and transformed itself into a major producer of a variety of indus- trial and consumer goods (DSM, 2009). Groningen gas production rose rapidly to more than 80 Gm3 by the mid-1970s (Roels, 2001) and as a result the Dutch primary energy consumption had experienced energy transition from solid to gaseous fuels that proceeded faster than in any other country."}
{"text": "Natural gas reached 1% of the country’s primary energy supply in 1958 (prior to the Groningen discovery this was methane recovered from coal mines), in 1965, when the decision was made to close down all of the country’s coal mines, natural gas supplied 5% of the country’s primary energy—but by 1971 it rose to 50% and by 1975, with almost 46%, it was only a couple of percent behind the imported crude oil; during the same time, coal’s share fell from 26% to 2.5% (the small remainder being mainly coking coal for smelting iron). After its brief peak output of the mid-1970s Groningen extraction was deliberately restricted in order to extend the ﬁeld’s lifetime; by 1990 more than half of Dutch gas sup- ply came from smaller onshore and offshore ﬁelds, and Groningen’s output fell to less than 30 Gm3 by the year 2000 (Roels, 2001)."}
{"text": "I will ﬁrst look at the transitions from biofuels to coal and oil during the nine- teenth century and then at the changing shares of fossil fuels. America’s commercial coal mining began in 1758 with a small shipment of Virginia coal to Manhattan Pennsylvania (with bituminous coal and anthracite) and Ohio, the other two states with extraction going back to the eighteenth century, were soon joined by Illinois and Indiana. Production estimates begin in 1800, when the three states in the Appalachia mined about 100,000 t of coal (Eavenson, 1942). Coal extraction sup- plied 5% of the total primary energy output by 1843, nearly a century after the beginning of commercial coal mining. The subsequent rise of coal was rapid, reach- ing 10% of all fuel energy supply just eight years after it passed the 5% mark, 20% share in two decades, a third in about 30 years, and half in just over four decades. In 1884 coal produced more energy than wood and by 1900 the U.S. coal industry produced two thirds ofall fuel energy."}
{"text": "U.S. commercial crude oil extraction began on a very small scale—15 barrels (about 2 t) a day from a single well—in 1859 at Oil Creek near Titusville, PA (Owen, 1975). U.S. oil extraction grew very rapidly, from less than 300 t in 1859 to about 70,000 t a year later, nearly 300,000 t in 1861, more than 700,000 t in 1870, 3.6 Mt in 1880, and close to 9 Mt in 1900. By that time Pennsylvania’s production—mainly from the country’s ﬁrst giant oilﬁelds in Bradford (discovered 1875) and Allegany (working since 1879)—was supplemented by extraction from California’s Brea-Olinda (since 1884) and McKittrick (since 1887) and soon after- ward (1894) from Corsicana ﬁeld in Texas. But oil’s rapidly expanding extraction remained a minuscule part of the country’s fossil fuel supply: In 1860 it provided 0.6% of all energy derived from fossil fuels, its share rose to 1% in 1870 and 4.4% by 1880 and then, as natural gas began to make its ﬁrst inroads, it fell to about 3.1% by the century’s end."}
{"text": "But because until the early 1880s wood was the country’s leading fuel (and because it still provided just over 20% of the total by 1900), oil’s contribution to the total primary energy supply remained marginal, rising from a mere 0.1% in 1860 to 0.3% in 1870, 1.9% in 1880, and 2.4% in 1900. U.S. oil production intensiﬁed right at the beginning of the twentieth century as new giant oilﬁelds (California’s Kern River, discovered in 1899, and Midway-Sunset in Texas, with its famous Spindletop gusher, drilled in 1901) began their production (Linsley, Rienstra, & Stiles, 2002). Discovery of the state’s biggest ﬁeld, the East Texas in 1930 (followed by the West Texas in 1936) led to supply glut and the enforce- ment of production quota by the Railroad Commission of Texas, whose monopoly lasted until 1971 (RCT, 1991)."}
{"text": "After World War II the pace of new major oil discoveries slowed down dra- matically, with Alaska’s North Slope being the only giant ﬁnd of the 1960s. The U.S. oil extraction peaked in 1970 with about 535 Mt and afterwards the country has become increasingly more dependent on oil imports—but it has become the world’s largest crude oil importer only because its per capita consumption of the fuel is so extraordinarily high: It remains the world’s third-largest producer and if it were to consume reﬁned oil products at the French rate (average annual crude oil supply of 1.4 t/capita rather than 2.9 t/capita) it could reduce its 2008 crude oil imports by nearly 80%, well below the current Japanese level!\n\nObviously, the downslope of the extraction curve has not mirrored its ascent: Hubbert’s (1956) often-cited production curve anticipated annual production of 1.2 billion barrels in 2000, but the actual rate was 2.8 billion barrels, nearly 2.5 times higher, and the output in 2008 was almost 70% above the rate forecast for that year. And because the declining domestic production was promptly sup- plemented by increasing crude oil (and reﬁned products) imports, there was at ﬁrst no, and later only a slight, decline in terms of the relative contribution of liquid fuels to the U.S. primary energy supply: The share was about 43.5% in 1970, 43.6% a decade later, and in 2008 it was still 38.5%."}
{"text": "Extraction of natural gas could not begin on a larger scale without long- distance pipelines, but once the fuel’s share reached 5% of all primary energy (in 1924) it expanded nearly as fast the oil production: Just 11 years later it was at 10%, after 27 years at 20%, and in 1957 natural gas surpassed 25% of the country’s primary energy production. Consumption trend was very similar and it kept rising until 1972 when it peaked at about 32.5%—but, as with crude oil consumption, this was not followed by any precipitous retreat. The fuel’s share declined to just below 23% by 1990 but since that time it has been on only a slightly ﬂuctuating plateau."}
{"text": "By 2010 coal would be down to only about 3%of the total primary energy supply,oil would be no higher than about 20%,while natural gas would have caimed about 75%of the market.And nuclear electricity generation has been yet another component of the U.S.primary energy source that has not con- formed to the clock-like substitution model but that has obviously reflected the politics and economics of the U.S.nuclear development with its slow begin- nings during the 1960s,major construction delays during the 1970s,the end of all new nuclear power plants orders in 1978,and impressive performance improvements during the 1980s and 1990s(Cantelon,Hewlett,&Williams, 1991;Smil,2003).Construction of most of the stations ordered before 1979 was completed by 1990(but the last reactor at Watts Bar station of the Tennessee Valley Authority,begun in 1973,was not completed until1996!),subsequent generation gains came from improved performance of reactors,and the shares of nudlear electricity,much like those of fossil fuels,reached a plateau."}
{"text": "As already noted, the United States offers a unique opportunity for a fairly reliable quantiﬁcation of the shifting shares of prime movers. Starting in 1850 the U.S. statistics list the total power of draft animals and ofall inanimate prime movers disaggregated as automotive engines, electricity-generating equipment, machines in factories, mines, and on farms, engines on railroads, ships, and air- craft as well as sailing vessels and windmills. The two series of available statistics are not in a close agreement as far as the total power of working animals is con- cerned. Daugherty (1927) puts it at about 5.8 GW in 1849 and 16.8 GW in 1899, the U.S. Bureau of Census (1975) at 4.4 GW in 1850 and at about 14 GW in 1900, differences of, respectively, about 30% and 20%; I will use the more conservative series."}
{"text": "I have used this information on prime mover capacities to calculate a more relevant indicator of the prime mover transition, namely the shares of actually performed useful work, and I include human labor in this account. These calcu- lations yield different shares than do the capacity numbers because the typical annual load factors of prime movers range from as little as 200 hours for car engines and about 1,000 (800–1,200) hours for draft animals to more than 6,000 hours for large steam turbogenerators. My estimates indicate that in 1850 nearly half of U.S. useful power was provided by animals, roughly a sixth by people, and just over a third by inanimate prime movers, overwhelmingly by steam engines complemented by water wheels, water turbines, and windmills."}
{"text": "But the situation was different on the country's farms.Total number of horses and mules on U.S.farms rose from about 5million in 1850 to about 20 million by 1900 and it peaked in 1918 at 26.72 million,but by 1940 there were still more than 13million draft animals(USBC,1975).As a result,the combined power of inanimate prime movers in agriculture surpassed the aggregate power of draft animals only at the beginning of the 1920s;by 1930 machine power was about 60%of the total,a decade later 80%,by 1950 it reached 90%,and by 1960 there were still more than three million horses on U.S.farms but their aggregate power was only about 1%of the total.The transition from animate to inanimate prime movers was accomplished—its Fisher-Pry plot shows the expected fairly straight lines—and the USDA stopped counting the draft animals."}
{"text": "The last important case of U.S. energy transitions I will consider is actually a remarkable absence of such a process as far as the primary sources of electricity generation are concerned. As already explained, thermal and hydro generation began simultaneously in 1882 and by 1890 water power produced about 25% of the total output of approximately 1 GWh; 60 years later the total rose to nearly 400 GWh and water power (whose share rose to as much as 35% during the ﬁrst two decades of the twentieth century) remained as important as in 1890, with 26% of the total. Its relative decline began only during the 1950s thanks to a rapid expansion of fossil-fueled generation, a process that continued during the 1960s (by 1970 coal-ﬁred generation was 4.5 times the 1950 level, and the multi- ples for oil- and natural gas-ﬁred generation were, respectively, about 5.5 and 8.3) when two new sources of electricity production—nuclear ﬁssion and geothermal steam—began to make small inroads."}
{"text": "Geothermal generation remained quite marginal (its share has never surpassed 0.5% of the total), but nuclear power, after passing the 1% mark in the ﬁrst quarter of 1970, ended the decade with a nearly 11% share. Completion of many nuclear plants after long construction delays and better performance of established reactors pushed the share steadily upwards during the 1980s and the early 1990s and it touched the 20% mark in 1995 before stabilizing at just below that level. As a result, by the year 2000 fossil-fueled generation—largely coal-ﬁred (73%), with natural gas at 22%, and liquid fuels at just 5%—was relatively more important (with about 72.5% of the total) than it was in 1900 when its share was about 65%."}
{"text": "While nuclear generation has become a major component of the country’s electricity supply, the most remarkable fact concerning the U.S. electricity system has been a highly conservative nature of its development as the two pioneering modes of thermal and hydro generation that accounted for 100% in 1900 had retreated to only about 80% by 2000. This high degree of inertia is even more remarkable given the fact that those two modes of electricity generation had expanded about 650 times during the twentieth century, from less than 5 GWh to nearly 3 TWh. This, of course, means that any new generation technique will have to deliver many hundreds of GWh in order to become an important con- tributor to the overall supply."}
{"text": "The only recent entrant with that potential has been wind power, and its pro- ponents stress its high rates of expansion driven by a combination of government subsidies, higher turbine capacities, and declining production costs. U.S. wind- driven electricity generation surpassed 0.1% of the total in 1999, 0.5% by 2006, and it reached 1.3% by the end of 2008. This has been undoubtedly a fast pace, but one that has not been unprecedented. U.S. wind generation rose 9.3 times between 2000 and 2008 (from 5.6 to 52 GWh), but during a similar early stage of its development nuclear generation increased much faster, more than 16-fold during the eight-year period between 1964 and 1972 (from 3.3 to 54.1 GWh). This is not surprising given the fact that average units in nuclear stations have power two orders of magnitude larger than average wind turbines."}
{"text": "After the Meiji Restoration (resumption of imperial power and the transfer of the capital from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1867) the country pursued a broad-based program of modernization, and energy transition became one of its critical com- ponents. Progress of Japan’s industrialization and militarization was so rapid that in 1895 Japan defeated China in a brief war and 10 years later it was once again victorious in a longer conﬂict with the imperial Russia (Jansen, 2000). Japan’s historical statistics contain a complete energy balance series starting in 1880— when wood and charcoal supplied 85% of all primary energy, coal 14%, and oil just over 1%—and hence they allow us to quantify the country’s energy tran- sition from its early stages (JSA, 1987–1988; Bank of Japan, 1999; IEE, 2009)."}
{"text": "Coal consumption surpassed the biomass energy in 1901 (when it claimed 57% of the total vs. about 39% for wood and charcoal) and rapid pre–WWII industrialization increased the aggregate energy use about 2.6-fold between 1920 and 1940, with the biomass share falling to only about 10%, coal (after peaking at about 77% in 1917) to about 66%, and hydroelectricity rising to 16% of the total. Defeat in World War II cost the country dearly: In 1946 energy use was 55% below the 1940 peak and that level was not surpassed until 1955. By that time Japan’s swiftly rising oil imports were shifting the country’s primary energy use toward hydrocarbons: Oil use surpassed coal energy in 1961 (with nearly 41% vs. about 39%; it was also the year when the domestic coal produc- tion peaked at about 55 Mt of coal equivalent by 1970 it reached almost 72%, and three years later it topped 77% of the total energy supply, a relative peak that was virtually identical to that reached by coal in 1917."}
{"text": "China has the earliest documented use of coal (in iron smelting), going back to the end of the Han dynasty. Coal was packed around tube-like crucibles ﬁlled with iron ore and the liquid iron was cast into interchangeable molds to produce plowshares, thin-walled cooking pots, and pans Although locally important, coal was not widely used, and even after modern coal production began during the 1880s its growth was slow and for decades it continued to be dwarfed by the country’s demand for biomass energies. Given China’s large rural population this demand was always huge in absolute terms—while per capita biomass energy con- sumption was always only a fraction of Western European and U.S. rates—because many regions have been deforested for centuries, and because recurrent droughts and poor harvests limited the availability of crop residues in the lowlands."}
{"text": "These rural energy shortages were widespread even at the beginning of China’s current modernization drive. The ﬁrst series of rural energy surveys done across China in 1979 set the average daily requirements at just 3.25–3.75 MJ of useful energy per day per capita (Smil, 1988). Given the average combustion efﬁciency of about 10%, this works out to annual per capita combustion of less than 13 GJ of biomass fuels, or only about 800 kg of woody biomass or nearly 900 kg of crop residues. In contrast (as shown previously in this chapter), annual preindustrial fuelwood use in the forest-rich United States averaged nearly 90 GJ/capita."}
{"text": "But the 1979 surveys showed that even the minimum energy needs were not often met, with the average supply shortfall amounting to just over 20%. In 1980 it was estimated that 500 million peasants (63% of the total) suffered from serious fuel shortages for at least three to ﬁve months of the year and by 1982 the nation- wide share was still nearly 50%, with the highest rates, in excess of 60%, in the worst affected provinces of Xinjiang, Hebei, Hunan, and Sichuan and in the most densely inhabited parts of Tibet. By the late 1980s rural energy shortages were much reduced thanks to the rising output of coal from small local mines, return of privately owned wood groves, and improved stove designs (raising typical efﬁ- ciencies from just 10–15% to 25–35%)."}
{"text": "My approximate reconstruction of China’s primary energy use shows the share of biomass energies fairly constant during the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, falling only marginally from more than 99% in 1900 to nearly 98% by 1949. Subsequent rapid increases in coal output lowered it to about 60% by 1957 and to 50% of the nationwide energy use by the mid-1960s. But in the countryside crop residues and woody phytomass still supplied about 90% of all household energy use during the early 1970s and this share fell to below 70% by 1980, below 50% by 1988, and to 33% by 1998 (Zheng, 1998; Fridley et al., 2008). In terms of the total primary energy supply the biomass supplied about 40% of the total in 1970 and in 1979 crop residues, ﬁrewood, and dung cakes still accounted for no less than 28%. By 2000 this share was more than halved to 13% and by 2007 it fell below 10%."}
{"text": "Much as in Europe or the United States, China’s post-1949 transition from biomass to fossil fuels was dominated by coal and details can be easily recon- structed from available statistics (SSB, 2009; Fridley et al., 2008). China’s case is an excellent illustration of both the slowness of energy transitions and of the imperatives of scale: The country’s demand for energy has been so large and its huge coal resources could be tapped so readily that it has proved impossible to displace to any signiﬁcant extent the fuel that is not only inconvenient to handle and gives rise to major air pollution problems but whose extraction (as practiced in China, particularly in small rural mines) has been also uncommonly deadly: During the ﬁrst ﬁve years of this century coal-mining fatalities averaged about 6,200/year, or nearly four deaths for every million tonnes of coal (Fridley et al., 2008)."}
{"text": "Total coal output in mines opened largely with foreign investment surpassed 1 Mt only by 1903, in 1911 it was just over 5 Mt, during the early 1930s (before Japan’s invasion of Manchuria in 1933) it was approaching 30 Mt, and in 1940 it reached about 46 Mt. When the Communist Party won the protracted civil war and took control in 1949 coal output was only about 32 Mt (Thomson, 2003). China’s ﬁrst Stalinist Five-Year Plan boosted the extraction to 130 Mt by 1957 and a key goal of Mao’s infamous Great Leap Forward was to produce more coal and steel than the United Kingdom. Ofﬁcial (grossly exaggerated) statistics had the coal extraction reaching nearly 400 Mt by 1960. Whatever the real total, most of this fuel was of inferior quality (with at least two-ﬁfths of it produced by primitive local mines) and it was largely wasted in the Maoist campaign of iron smelting in primitive ‘‘backyard’’ furnaces which, in turn, was a principal reason for the world’s largest man-made famine as it diverted labor from food production (Smil, 1999)."}
{"text": "In the early 1950s China derived more than 95% of its primary commercial energy (leaving biomass contributions aside) from coal, and the share was still over 90% by the end of the ﬁrst Five-Year Plan in 1957. After a supergiant Daqing oil ﬁeld went into production coal’s share decreased to about 86% in 1965, 80% in 1970, and 72% by 1975. During the ﬁrst year of the modernization drive the share actually rose to 76%; by 1985, a decade later, it declined only marginally to just over 74%; by 2002 it was down to just over 65% but then it began rising once again and it just surpassed 70% in 2008. Given an extraordinary rise of China’s total primary energy supply (it doubled between 2000 and 2008), this means that China’s coal extraction more than doubled in just eight years, from about 1.3 Gt in 2000 to nearly 2.8 Gt in 2008."}
{"text": "With China’s coal shares at nearly 73% in 1980 and at 70% in 2008 it is obvious that during the three decades of rapid modernization there was only the tardiest of transitions from solid fuel to hydrocarbons. China’s extraordinary dependence on coal means that the country now accounts for more than 40% of the world extraction, and that the mass it produces annually is larger than the aggregate output of the United States, India, Australia, Russia, Indonesia, and Germany, the world’s second- to seventh-largest coal producers. No other major economy, in fact no other country, is as dependent on coal as China: The fuel has also recently accounted for 95% of all fossil fuels used to produce electricity and as the thermal generation supplies nearly 80% of China’s total generation it is the source of more than 70% of electric power."}
{"text": "China was self-sufﬁcient in crude oil between the mid-1960s (when it pro- duced less than 15 Mt/year) and 1992 when it extracted about 142 Mt, exported 39 Mt of crude oil and reﬁned products, and imported about 28 Mt. Imports remained low, below 50 Mt/year, until 2000; by 2004 they surpassed 100 Mt and by 2008 they were nearly 180 Mt, making China the world’s third-largest buyer of oil (after the United States and Japan). In addition, between 2000 and 2008 China’s domestic crude oil extraction rose by 17% to about 190 Mt/ year—but even this combination of steadily growing production and rapidly rising inputs could not prevent the oil’s share of primary energy supply from falling from the peak of nearly 24% in 2002 to less than 19% by 2008."}
{"text": "In contrast to its relatively poor natural gas production potential,China has the world's largest water power capacity and its development brought its share of the total primary energy supply from less than 2%during the early 1950s to 5%by the late 1980s,and the subsequent development of large hydro projects (induding Sanxia,the world's largest hydro station on the Chang Jiang in Hubei,whose installed capacity willbe eventually 22.5 GW)increased the share to nearly 7%by 2008.Hydroelectricity thus remains much more important than nudlear generation:Many bold plans for its development remained just that and its share has yet to reach 1%of the total(it was 0.8%in 2008).Unlike in all major Western economies and Japan where the two kinds of hydrocarbons now account for the largest share of primary energy supply,China has thus basically accomplished only the transition from biomass to coal,and there is no early prospect(no prospect at all?)for hydrocarbons surpassing coal's contribution."}
{"text": "But the pre-revolutionary Russia was far behind the United States in terms of energy consumption, and the country’s tipping point from wood to fossil fuels and primary electricity came only during the Soviet era (about half a century after coal surpassed wood in the United States), and the overall Soviet per capita energy consumption, and even more so the discretionary energy use by house- holds, have never approached the U.S. levels. On the other hand, given Russia’s rich resource endowment and its pioneering role in the development of oil indus- try, it is hardly surprising that the early phases ofthe Russian primary energy tran- sitions had some key features common with the U.S. pattern."}
{"text": "History of the Russian Empire (pre-1917), of the USSR (beginning in 1917 with the Bolshevik take-over, or in 1921 with the formal constitution of the Soviet Union), and the new Russia (following the peaceful dissolution of the USSR in December 1991) presents numerous challenges of adjusting statistics due to changing territorial extent and population counts. However, all but a small portion of the transition from wood to fossil fuels had taken place during the decades of the Soviet power (1917–1991), the era for which basic fuel and annual electricity statistics are available from the USSR’s Central Statistical Ofﬁce (Tsentral’noie statisticheskoie upravlenie SSSR), although their accuracy has been always questionable."}
{"text": "Soviet historical statistics put the share of fuelwood in 1913 at 20% of primary energy production (TsSU 1977) but that obviously refers only to commercially produced fuel whose total prorated to merely 1.5 GJ/year per capita, roughly 1/20 of the U.S. per capita rate in 1900, half of the Russian rate for 2005. Such a low rate was only a very small fraction of energy needed to heat a typical Russian wooden residence. Even a small house in northern part of European Russia or in Siberia would have required at least 100 GJ/year and recall that in 1850 the U.S. households averaged no less than 100 GJ/year. My best estimates indicate that by 1913 wood supplied no less than 75% of Russia’s primary energy and that the aggregate consumption of fossil fuels and primary electricity surpassed that of fuelwood only during the early 1930s (compared to the U.S. tipping point half a century earlier in 1884/1885)."}
{"text": "The second shift began with the discoveries of supergiant fields in Western Siberia,an oil-bearing province twice the size of Alaska.The first indication of that basin's hydrocarbon riches came with an accidental gas and water gusher right at the outset of drilling R-1 Beryozovo well in September 1953(Karpov,2008). Principal discoveries came only during the early 1960s with the discoveries of supergiant Samotlor and Ust'-Balyk in 1961 and Mamontovo in 1965(EIA, 1997).These fields were rapidly developed and connected by long-distance pipe- lines to the European USSR and to Central and Western Europe,and their output still dominates the Russian extraction."}
{"text": "History of the USSR was shaped by deliberately grandiose electriﬁcation plans. Lenin’s famous dictum that Communism equals Soviet power plus elec- tricity was put into practice by the establishment of the State Commission for Electriﬁcation of Russia (GOELRO) and its plans for expansion of both thermal and hydro generating capacities (Nesteruk, 1963). These were not always the most efﬁcient ways to develop the country’s electric industry, and projects com- pleted during the pre–WWII years also exacted a high price in terms of human suffering and death (many were built with forced labor from GULag). Even more grandiose plans followed after World War II but, fortunately, only some of them were realized: Perhaps the greatest unrealized project was, thankfully, the diversion of great Siberian rivers to the arid core of the Soviet Central Asia."}
{"text": "The history of Soviet energy consumption is one of impressive absolute gains, be they in aggregate or per capita terms, as total domestic energy supply increased from 1.1 EJ in 1913 to 59 EJ in 1990 (a nearly 54-fold expansion) and as annual per capita use had tripled from about 70 GJ to more than 210 GJ. But the coun- try’s energy transition—disrupted by the two devastating wars and a protracted civil war following the Communist seizure of power, and affected by decades of Stalinist mismanagement—has been very idiosyncratic, with its long dominance by coal, decades of relatively high share claimed by oil that amount to an extended plateau (30% in 1913, 27% in 1940, 34% in 1970, 30% in 1990), and a rapid post-1950 rise of natural gas."}
{"text": "Saudi Arabia’s economic development is a perfect example of a very rapid tran- sition from a poor preindustrial and largely nomadic society, to one of the world’s largest energy consumers and the largest crude oil exporter—all of that due to the combination of unrivaled oil resources and a relatively small, albeit rapidly grow- ing, population (about 26 million in 2010, compared to Iran’s 75 million, Nigeria’s nearly 160 million, and Indonesia’s more than 230 million). When the country was created in 1932 as a loose federation of desert tribes with Abdul Aziz as its king its primary energy consumption was at a very low subsistence level (less than 5 GJ/ capita, comparable to today’s use in the poorest regions of sub-Saharan Africa), with most of the fuel for cooking and water heating coming from the burning of biomass (including desert brush twigs, camel dung, and date kernels) by the desert nomads and by using imported coal and kerosene in a few coastal settlements."}
{"text": "The king granted the oil concession to Casoc (California Arabian Standard Oil Company) in 1933, ﬁrst oil discovery came in 1938, and the ﬁrst small tanker shipment came a year later (Clark & Tahlawi, 2006). In 1944 Casoc changed its name to Aramco (Arabian American Oil Company) and a year later, when the reﬁnery in Rs Tanra (now the world’s largest oil-loading terminal) began its operation, the country produced more than 5 Mt of oil and the output reached nearly 27 Mt by 1950. By the mid-1950s it became clear that the country has both the world’s largest supergiant ﬁeld, al-Ghawr, and the world’s largest offshore oil ﬁeld (Safaniya). Oil output more than doubled during the 1950s and then it nearly tripled during the 1960s. Saudi oil production continued to increase during the 1970s (with only a single-year decline in 1975) and it reached its highest level in 1980 with 495.89 Mt."}
{"text": "This was followed by a precipitous slump (caused by OPEC’s record-high demand-destroying price run-up between 1979 and 1981) to just 172 Mt by the year 1985, but after the demise of the USSR the country became the world’s largest oil producer by surpassing the Russian extraction in 1992, and it has con- tinued to maintain this primacy ever since. In contrast to rapidly rising exports, the Saudi domestic consumption remained rather low until the mid-1970s (in 1975 it was virtually unchanged from the 1965 level), but then it tripled by 1985 and nearly tripled again by 2008, reaching about 175 Mtoe or roughly 270 GJ/capita (compared to about 175 GJ/capita for the richest EU countries). This means that by the late 1970s Saudi per capita use of primary energy sur- passed the means of the richest European states and that the country’s transition from preindustrial subsistence to a high-energy society took just 40 years when measured from the ﬁrst oil discovery in 1938 or (when using a more meaningful delimitation) only about 25 years when measured from the beginning of the post–WWII modernization during the early 1950s."}
{"text": "But two important caveats are in order. The high mean of the Saudi per capita energy consumption is misleading because a large part of the overall energy demand is claimed by the oil and gas industry itself and because it also includes substantial amounts of bunker fuel for oil tankers exporting the Saudi oil and reﬁned products. Average energy use by households remains considerably lower than in the richest EU countries. Even more importantly, Saudi Arabia’s high energy consumption has not yet translated into a commensurately high quality of life: Infant mortality remains relatively high and the status of women is notori- ously low. As a result, the country has one of the world’s largest differences in the ranking between per capita GDP and the Human Development Index (UNDP, 2009). In this it is a typical Muslim society: In recent years 20 out of 24 Muslim countries in North Africa and the Middle East ranked higher in their GDP per capita than in their HDI—and in 2007/2008 the index difference for Saudi Arabia was −19 while for Kuwait and Bahrain it was −8 and for Iran it was −23."}
{"text": "The Soviet and Saudi examples illustrate the rapidity with which even a large economy or a latecomer to modern development can accomplish its energy transition—but it must be remembered that this would not have been possible without those countries’ exceptionally rich fossil fuel (and in the Russian case also of water power) endowment. Consequently, the Soviet or Saudi energy transitions have limited implications for economies that have minimal, or no, domestic resources and (to make the bridge to the next chapter) they offer no insight into the coming shift from fossil fuels to renewable energies. Moving away from fossil fuels will be a protracted affair even in those countries where the requisite resources are readily available, because every society will have to deal with the twin challenge of low power density and intermittent ﬂows of renewable energies."}
{"text": "Regrettably, my interpretation of the past evidence and my understanding of the current capabilities to act, and to persist, favors the ﬁrst reason: Lessons of the past energy transitions may not be particularly useful for appraising and handicapping the coming transition because it will be exceedingly difﬁcult to restructure the modern high-energy industrial and postindustrial civilization on the basis of non-fossil—that is, overwhelmingly renewable—fuels and ﬂows. I use the qualiﬁer ‘‘overwhelmingly’’ in order to leave some room for a possibility of substantially increased nuclear electricity generation—although the combined challenges ofthe industry’s public acceptance, long-term fuel availability, perma- nent waste storage, and nuclear weapons proliferation do not make any early vig- orous and widespread renaissance very likely."}
{"text": "Our energy choices have not been foreclosed—but we have to recognize that they are, at least in the near- to mid-term, restricted by availability and convert- ibility of individual resources and by the pace of technical innovation and social adaptation. Following my long-standing practice of not making any quantitative point forecasts I will not offer any absolute predictions for particular years or time periods, be it on the global scale or for individual nations. Instead, I will examine ﬁrst the fundamental contours of the coming energy transition by explaining the magnitudes of available non-fossil resources and major con- straints on their conversions, above all their low power densities."}
{"text": "In contrast, it appears that today’s situation is markedly different, a state of affairs that should make the coming transition to non-fossil energies a less taxing experience. After all, we have now an enormous wealth of relevant scientiﬁc under- standing, as yet no disruptive shortages of high-performance metals and materials that are needed at every stage of energy harnessing and conversion are imminent, advanced manufacturing processes are able to prototype new designs rapidly and to take advantage of the economies of scale (recent scaling-up of wind turbines to multi-MW ratings is an excellent example of these capabilities), our technical capacities to put in place new infrastructures are unprecedented, and there are highly competitive global markets for nearly all important techniques and products."}
{"text": "The second concern is related above all to the alleged imminence of global peak oil extraction to be followed by a fairly rapid decline of global oil produc- tion, but there have been also some indications that the world’s coal resources may be signiﬁcantly less abundant than the widespread impressions would indi- cate (Rutledge, 2008)."}
{"text": "This is not a place to assess the merits of these concerns; many recent works have done so in a great detail. But even if the current perceptions of these threats turned out to be exaggerated, there are many other good reasons for favoring a shift of the global energy supply away from fossil fuels, whose extraction and conversion has many undesirable environmental impacts including the emissions of CH4 (a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2), black carbon (another important factor in atmospheric change), and oxides of sulfur and nitrogen (both being the precursors of acid deposition and the latter one also a key ingredient in the forma- tion of photochemical smog)."}
{"text": "The scale of the coming energy transition is best illustrated by comparing the future demand for non-fossil fuels and primary electricity with the past demand for fossil energies that were needed to complete the epochal shift from biomass to coal and hydrocarbons. By the late 1890s, when the share of biomass energies slipped just below 50% of the world’s total primary energy supply, less than 20 EJ of additional fossil fuel supply were needed to substitute all of the remain- ing biomass energy consumption. By 2010 the global use of fossil energies runs at the annual rate of roughly 400 EJ, which means that the need for new non- fossil energy supply to displace coal and hydrocarbons is 20 times greater in overall energy terms than was the need for fossil energies during the 1890s."}
{"text": "There are nine major kinds of renewable energies: solar radiation; its six transfor- mations as running water (hydro energy), wind, wind-generated ocean waves, ocean currents, thermal differences between the ocean’s surface and deep waters, and photosynthesis (primary production); geothermal energy and tidal energy complete the list. As with fossil fuels, it is imperative to distinguish between renewable resources (aggregates of available ﬂuxes) and reserves, their smaller (or very small) portions that are economically recoverable with existing extraction or conversion techniques. This key distinction applies as much to wind or waste cellulosic biomass as it does to crude oil or uranium, and that is why the often-cited enormous ﬂows of renewable resources give no obvious indication as to the shares that can be realisti- cally exploited."}
{"text": "Global reserves of renewable ﬂows can be accurately determined only by careful assessment of regional and local limits, not by applying some generic frac- tions. For example, storing too much water for hydro generation could weaken many environmental services provided by ﬂowing river water (including silt and nutrient transportation, channel cutting, and oxygen supply to aquatic biota), large-scale biofuel cultivation and repeated removal of excessive shares of photosynthetic production could further undermine the health of many natural ecosystems and agroecosystems by extending monocultures and opening ways for greater soil erosion and pest infestation, and harnessing signiﬁcant shares of wind energy could affect regional climates and conceivably even the global air circulation."}
{"text": "How much of this theoretically available ﬂux will be actually captured remains highly uncertain; a 10% share (about 7 TW) would be half of today’s fossil fuel extraction. Potential energy of the global stream runoff adds up to nearly 10 TW, of which slightly more than 10% can be economically exploited by dams, and more than a third of that has been already harnessed. Wind- driven ocean waves have kinetic energy of some 60 TW of which only 3 TW (5%) are dissipated along the coasts. Ocean currents have power of at least 100 GW but only a very small part (on the order of a few GW) can be converted."}
{"text": "Tidal energy amounts to about 3 TW, of which only some 60 GWare dissi- pated in coastal waters. Ocean thermal gradient totals some 100 TW but because of the small temperature difference (maximum of about 20 K) its large-scale commercial use remains questionable. Terrestrial photosynthesis proceeds at a rate of nearly 60 TW, and even a tripling of biomass currently used for energy would not yield more than about 9 TW. Finally, the Earth’s geothermal ﬂux amounts to about 42 TW (Sclater, Jaupart, & Galson, 1980), but nearly 80% of that large total is through the ocean ﬂoor and all but a small fraction of it is a low-temperature diffuse heat. Available production techniques using hot steam could tap up to about 140 GW for electricity generation by the year 2050 (Bertani, 2009), and even if three times as much could be used for low- temperature heating the total would be less than 600 GW."}
{"text": "Reviewing the potentially usable maxima of renewable energy ﬂows shows a sobering reality. First, direct solar radiation is the only form of renewable energy whose total terrestrial ﬂux far surpasses not only today’s demand for fossil fuels but also any level of global energy demand realistically imaginable during the twenty-ﬁrst century (and far beyond). Second, only an extraordinarily high rate of wind energy capture (that may be environmentally undesirable and techni- cally problematic) could provide a signiﬁcant share of overall future energy demand. Third, for all other renewable energies maxima available for commer- cial harnessing fall far short of today’s fossil fuel ﬂux, one order of magnitude in the case of hydro energy, biomass energy, ocean waves, and geothermal energy, two orders of magnitude for tides, and four orders of magnitude for ocean cur- rents and ocean thermal differences."}
{"text": "Biomass contributions could be increased by large-scale removal and conver- sion of waste (cellulosic) phytomass, mainly logging residues and cereal straws— but, once again, while this resource is large, its reserves (the share that can be repeatedly taken away without adverse effects) are limited. Logging residues from clear-cutting can yield a relatively high one-time harvest but those at remote sites and those left on steep slopes may not be economically recoverable and even the best efforts to collect the accessible resources may not gather more than half of the available wastes. And in most agroecosystems crop residues are a more valuable resource when they are recycled—in order to maintain soil’s organic content, to retain moisture, and to prevent soil erosion—rather than when they are removed for fuel."}
{"text": "And while there is undoubtedly a very large theoretical potential for biomass harvested from new plantings of fast-growing trees and high-yielding grasses on currently unused land, those favoring such mega-planting schemes must ﬁrst explain how they will supply the requisite water and macronutrients needed to sustain those plantings. Yet another proposal would cultivate nearly 90% of new energy crops on land that is now used for food production but that would be made superﬂuous by greatly increased efﬁciency of food cropping. One wish- ful assessment estimated the future biomass contribution at no less than about 365 EJ (nearly equal to all fossil fuels today) and it put the maximum potential by the year 2050 as high as 1.442 ZJ, more than three times today’s total global energy use (Smeets et al., 2007). Improbability of this total led the authors them- selves to admit that ‘‘such increases in productivity may be unrealistically high’’ (Smeets et al., 2007, p. 56)—but they use them anyway as the foundation for their meaningless claims."}
{"text": "The third obvious fact complicating large-scale development of most of the renewable energy ﬂows is their intermittency, some of which is perfectly predict- able (daily availability of solar radiation in cloud-free subtropical settings; time and magnitude of local tides) but most of which can be only forecast with vary- ing degrees of probability, particularly as far as longer term outlook is concerned (availability of solar radiation in cloudy mid-latitudes, timing and frequency of winds, seasonal harvests of phytomass affected by climate variations and pest infestations). There are two effective solutions for intermittency: storage in the case of fuels, and long-distance interconnections in the case of electricity generation."}
{"text": "Mass production of liquid biofuels fermented from annual harvests of crop or residual biomass would require large storages of either cereal or cellulosic feed- stocks or the produced ethanol (or both), and the bulkiness of residues and rel- atively low energy densities of all of these materials would make such storages more costly than those of reﬁned oils. New long-distance HV links will be appraised later in this chapter but they, too, would obviously entail signiﬁcant initial infrastructural investment, a reality that militates against any rapid sus- tained contributions that renewable conversions sited in locations far away from major load centers could make to future energy balances."}
{"text": "The fourth key consideration is that in terms of energy densities the coming shift will move the global energy system in the opposite, and less desirable, direc- tion than did the epochal transition to fossil fuels that introduced fuels with superior energy densities: transition to non-fossil fuels rests on less energy- dense biofuels whose larger mass (for the equivalent energy supply) will require more handling and larger storages. As already explained (in chapter 1), even ordinary bituminous coal contains 30–50% more energy than air-dry wood, while the best hard coals are nearly twice as energy-dense as wood and liquid fuels reﬁned from crude oil have nearly three times higher energy density than air-dry phytomass. A biomass-burning power plant would need a mass of fuel 30–50% larger than a coal-ﬁred station of the same capacity. Similarly, ethanol fermented from crop carbohydrates has an energy density of 24 MJ/L, 30% less than gasoline (and biodiesel has an energy density about 12% lower than diesel fuel)."}
{"text": "Constraints are even more obvious as far as the substitution of reﬁned oil products is concerned. Even if all of the world’s sugar cane crop were converted to ethanol, the annual ethanol yield would be less than 5% of the global gasoline demand in 2010. Even if the entire U.S. corn harvest was converted to ethanol, it would produce an equivalent of less than 15% of the country’s recent annual gasoline consumption. Biofuel enthusiasts envisage bioreﬁneries using plant feedstocks that replace current crude oil reﬁneries—but they forget that unlike the highly energy-dense oil that is produced with high power density, biomass is bulky, tricky to handle, and contains a fairly high share of water."}
{"text": "This makes its transport to a centralized processing facility uneconomical (and too energy intensive) beyond a restricted radius (maximum of about 80 km) and, in turn, this supply constraint limits the throughput of a bioreﬁnery and the range of fuels to be produced—to say nothing about the yet-to-be- traversed path from laboratory benches to mass-scale production (Willems, 2009). A thoughtful review of biofuel prospects summed it up well: They can be an ingredient of the future energy supply but ‘‘realistic assessments ofthe pro- duction challenges and costs ahead impose major limits’’ (Sinclair, 2009, p. 407)."}
{"text": "And ﬁnally, the proponents of massive biomass harvesting ignore a worrisome fact that modern civilization is already claiming (directly and indirectly) a very high share of the Earth’s net terrestrial primary productivity (NPP), the total of new phytomass that is photosynthesized in the course of a single year and that is dominated by the production of woody tissues (boles, branches, bark, roots) in tropical and temperate forests. Most of this photosynthate should be always left untouched in order to support all other nonhuman heterotrophs (from archaea and bacteria to primates) and to perform, directly or indirectly via the heterotrophs, numerous indispensable environmental services."}
{"text": "Given this fact it is astonishing, and obviously worrisome, that three indepen- dently conducted studies (Vitousek et al., 1986; Rojstaczer, Sterling, & Moore, 2001; Imhoff et al., 2004) agree that human actions are already appropriating perhaps as much as 40% of the Earth’s NPP as cultivated food, ﬁber, and feed, as the harvests of wood for pulp, timber, and fuel, as grass grazed by domesti- cated animals, and as ﬁres deliberately set to maintain grassy habitats or to con- vert forests to other uses. This appropriation is also very unevenly distributed, with minuscule rates in some thinly populated areas of tropical rain forests to shares in excess of 60% in East Asia and to more than 70% in Western Europe (Imhoff et al., 2004). Local rates are even higher in the world’s most intensively cultivated agroecosystems of the most densely populated regions of Asia (China’s Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong, Indonesia’s Java, Bangladesh, the Nile Delta)."}
{"text": "Phytomass would have a chance to become, once again, a major component of the global primary energy supply only if we were to design new photosyn- thetic pathways that did not emerge during hundreds of millions of years of autotrophic evolution or if we were able to produce fuels directly by genetically manipulated bacteria. The latter option is now under active investigation, with Exxon being its most important corporate sponsor and Venter’s Synthetic Genomics its leading scientiﬁc developer (Service, 2009). Overconﬁdent gene manipulators may boast of soon-to-come feats of algally produced gasoline, but how soon would any promising yields achieved in controlled laboratory conditions be transferable to mass-scale cultivation?\n\nAs always in global energy supply, the scale matters: A laboratory bioreactor yields a few liters ofa product per day, but ifwe were to replace half of liquid fuels reﬁned from crude oil with algal hydrocarbons our daily output would have to be on the order of seven billion liters, and ranging from light (gasoline-like) to heavy (residual fuel-like) fraction. And maximized and highly targeted algal photosynthesis will be always predicated on maintaining many environmental optima, namely those of water temperature (minimal ﬂuctuation around a species-speciﬁc preference), water oxygen concentration, pH, alkalinity, light intensity, and plant density (high densities depress photosynthesis) and on providing adequate nutrients: Naturally, a great deal of energy would be required to operate such high-throughput cultivation. These real- ities make it clear that even if we already had superior hydrocarbon-producing algae their adoption as a globally important component of primary energy supply would not be a matter of a decade or two."}
{"text": "We thus come back to direct solar radiation as the only renewable energy ﬂux distinguished not only by its abundance but also by its relatively high power den- sity. No other renewable energy ﬂux comes even close to the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth at such a relatively high power density—and that density of capture could increase by an order of magnitude if we could harness sunlight in space, a concept that goes back to Glaser (1968), or on the lunar surface (Criswell, 2000) and beam the microwave energy back to the Earth."}
{"text": "These are conceptually very rational proposals—but with no chance of large- scale commercialization during the coming generation or two (although in 2009 Space Energy company claimed it will go commercial in 10 years)."}
{"text": "Solar radiation reaching the ground has the highest ﬂux in cloud-free sub- tropics; for example, in northeastern Saudi Arabia the maximum power densities are more than 1,100 W/m2 during the peak insolation hours and the highest daily means go up to 350 W/m2 (Sahin, Aksakal, & Kahraman, 2000). Annual continental average has the global mean of about 170 W/m2 and the oceanic means is slightly higher at 180 W/m2. Average insolation densities of 102 W/m2 mean that even with today’s relatively low-efﬁciency PV conversions (the best rates in everyday operation are still below 20%) we can produce electricity with power densities of around 30 W/m2, and if today’s best experimental designs (multijunc- tion concentrators with efﬁciency of about 40%) become commercial realities we could see PV generation power densities averaging more than 60 W/m2 and surpassing 400 W/m2 during the peak insolation hours."}
{"text": "Even if we assume (quite optimistically) that the cultivation of phytomass for energy could average 1 W/m2, then supplanting today’s 12.5 TW of fossil fuels would require 12,500,000 km2, roughly an equivalent of the entire territories of the United States and India, an area more than 400 times larger than the space taken up by all of modern energy’s infrastructures. If only half of today’s fossil fuel consumption were replaced by woody biomass, its plantations would require an area a bit larger than that of all existing forests in North America."}
{"text": "118 ENERGY TRANSITIONS\n\nLow extraction power densities would be the greatest challenge in producing liquid fuels from phytomass.If all of America's gasoline demands were to be derived from corn-based ethanol,the crop would have to be grown on an area roughly 20%larger than is the country's total arable land.And land daims of corn-based ethanol would be much worse outside the United States:Global corn-yield averages only a bit more than half of the U.S.mean."}
{"text": "There are two fundamental problems with this unfortunate comparison."}
{"text": "Steadily rising performance of microprocessors(chips)has hardly anything to do(as implied by Gore:“also made out of silicon”)with any declines in price of silicon.True,that exacting process of producing extremely pure polycrystal- line silicon and converting it into crystals that are sliced into thin wafers has become less expensive over time—but a blank silicon wafer represents only about 2%of the total value of a finished microprocessor.That phenomenal increase in microchip performance(and hence a hugedrop in cost per unit oper- ation)has been due overwhelmingly to the ability of crowding more transistors on the miniature wafer(Smil,2006).In 1965,when the early integrated circuits contained just 50 transistors,Gordon Moore predicted that their density will be doubling every 12 months(Moore,1965),and 10 years later he lengthened the doubling period to two years."}
{"text": "Even the most rapid past transitions to more efﬁcient energy converters and to more powerful prime movers did not come anywhere close to the rates dictated by Moore’s law. For example, the largest marine diesel engines increased their power rating about six-fold between 1950 and the year 2000, while gas turbines in ﬂight increased their maximum power roughly ten-fold in 25 years, from de Havilland’s Ghost engine with thrust of 22 kN in 1945 to Pratt & Whitney’s JT9D with the thrust of 210 kN certiﬁed in 1969 (Smil, 2010b). More impor- tantly, for some basic energy production processes and conversions—be it surface extraction and unit train transportation of coal, crude oil shipment by tankers and the fuel’s processing in reﬁneries, turbogenerators in thermal power plants, or long-distance transmission voltages—there have been either no, or only mar- ginal, gains in the best performance or in maximum ratings and unit capacities during the past four decades."}
{"text": "Perhaps the most important case of this technical stasis has been the efﬁciency of thermal generation, now the source of four-ﬁfths of the world’s electricity. Capacity of typical steam turbo-generating units has been stagnant since the early 1970s and both the maximum and average efﬁciency of fossil-fueled power plants have not improved since the early 1960s (Yeh & Rubin, 2003; EIA, 2009). U.S. statistics show average consumption of 11.1 MJ/kWh in 1970 and 10.9 MJ/kWh in 2000, a tiny 2% gain in three decades. Unfortunately, there are no parallels between rising microchip capacities and improving performance of energy conversions, and the idea of accelerating technical progress does not apply to any fundamental advances in energy harnessing and use."}
{"text": "Hendriks(2008)argues that building such structures is technically possible, because the Eiffel tower had surpassed 300 m already in 1889 and because we routinely build supertankers and giant container vessels whose length approaches 400m,and assemble bridges whose individual elements have mass more than 5,000 t.That this comparison is guilty of a categorical mistake(as none of those structures is surmounted by massive moving rotors)is not actually so important: What matters are the economies of such giant turbines and,as Bulder (2009) conduded,those are not at all obvious.This is mainly because the weight stresses are proportional to the turbine radius(making longer blades more susceptible to buckling)and because the turbine's energy yield goes up with the square of its radius while the mass (i.e.,the turbine's cost)goes up with the cube of the radius."}
{"text": "And Gore’s silicon analogy is no less ﬂawed when applied to PV generation, a technique whose major applications have been actually based on silicon wafers. True, the cost of producing PV cells has declined substantially—from $100/W in 1970 to about $1/W—and this trend has been sufﬁciently impressive to engender expectations of further cost declines and to foresee an early arrival of grid-parity when the cost of decentralized PV generation will equal the cost of electricity delivered by the existing grid with electricity generated largely from the combustion of fossil fuel. Again, corrective perspectives are in order. While some producers can now turn out their cells at $1/W, the average U.S. retail price of complete PV modules was $4.60/W in 2009, and this price represented just over half of the total retail cost for a residential rooftop PV system (about $8.75/W in 2009), with balance of the system and installation accounting for most of the remainder (Solarbuzz, 2009)."}
{"text": "If the cost of complete PV modules were to be halved every 18 months then in just 10 years it would drop to 1% of today’s value and the modules selling for close to $5/W would cost less than $0.05/W, and they would be producing the cheapest electricity in history. That is, obviously, quite impossible, and the PV industry’s more realistic expectations are to reduce the price of typical mod- ules to $1.5–2/W within 10 years, implying a halving of the cost in seven to eight years. But this does not mean that the cost of actual PV installations will be halved as well, because the costs of other components (inverters and regula- tors) and the cost of installation may not fall that fast. After all, despite the fall- ing costs of PV cells, the cost of electricity generated by typical residential systems (with capacities of about 2 kW) has hardly changed since the year 2000, when it was close to 40 cents/kWh: During the second half of 2009 it was still between 35 and 36 c/kWh. And even the largest industrial installations (up to 500 kW) were generating electricity in 2009 almost as expensively as in 2000 at 19–20 c/kWh (Solarbuzz, 2009)."}
{"text": "124 ENERGY TRANSITIONS\n\nMoreover, if there is to be early grid parity for decentralized PV systems then the total installed module cost of $8.75/W in 2009 would have to fall to about $2/Wand the overall cost of producing PV cells would have to be just around $1/W. But because in the past each doubling of cumulative production volume reduced the module costs by some 20%, nearly seven doublings (more than 100-fold volume increase) would be needed to bring today’s price to that level. And this would not sufﬁce, as we would also have to assume that the non-PV costs would be declining at a comparable rate, a clearly optimistic assumption, especially as far as the cost of installation and maintenance labor is concerned."}
{"text": "In any case, even the most enthusiastic advocates of PV electricity do not envis- age a 100-fold rise in cumulative installations in a matter of years, and slower rates of cost decline would defer the time of grid parity, and hence the real beginning of large-scale diffusion of PV generation, until after 2020 or 2025. However, Yang (2010) uses the history of solar hot water systems to argue that even at that point the diffusion of decentralized rooftop PV installations may be relatively slow. Solar hot water systems have been cost-effective (saving electricity at a cost well below grid parity) in sunny regions for decades, and with nearly 130 GW installed world- wide they are clearly also a mature innovation—and yet less than 1% of all U.S. households have chosen to install them (Davidson, 2005)."}
{"text": "This means that even the best conversions in research laboratories have required 15–20 years to double their efﬁciency and that another doubling for multijunction and monocrystalline cells is highly unlikely. Similarly, fundamen- tal physical and biochemical limits restrict the performance of other renewable energy conversions, be it the maximum yield of crops grown for fuel or woody biomass or the power to be harnessed from waves or tides: These limits will assert themselves after only relatively modest improvements of today’s perfor- mance and hence no strings of successive performance doublings are ahead."}
{"text": "Production of microprocessors is a costly activity,with the fabrication facili- ties costing at least $2-3(and future ones up to$10)billion.But given the entirely automated nature of the production process(with microprocessors used to design more advanced fabrication facilities)and a massive annual output of these factories,the entire world can be served by only a small number of chip- making facilities.Intel,whose share of the global microprocessor market remains dose to 80%,has only 15 operating silicon wafer fabrication facilities in nine locations around the world,and two new units under construction (Intel,2009), and worldwide there are only about 300 plants making high-grade silicon.Such an infrastructural sparsity is the very opposite of the situation prevailing in energy production,delivery,and consumption."}
{"text": "These infrastructures are present in high densities in all afﬂuent nations, and modernizing countries are building them as rapidly as they can. Certainly the most impressive example is China’s coal-based quest for modernity. During the ﬁrst eight years of the twenty-ﬁrst century China more than doubled its coal extraction and it added almost 300 GW of new coal-ﬁred electricity-generating capacity, more than the combined thermal-generating capacity installed in the EU’s ﬁve largest economies (Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain) by 2006 (EIA, 2008). Even by using a very conservative cost average of $1,000/kW the latter building spree represents an investment on the order of $300 billion and these plants will operate for at least 30–35 years to recover their cost and to make proﬁt."}
{"text": "Could anybody expect that the Chinese will suddenly terminate this brand-new investment and turn to costlier methods of electricity generation that remain rela- tively unproven and that are not readily available at GW scale? In global terms, could we expect that the world will simply walk away from fossil and nuclear energy infra- structures whose replacement cost is worth at least $15–20 trillion before these investments will be paid for and produce rewarding returns? Negative answers to these questions are obvious. But the infrastructural argument cuts forward as well because new large-scale infrastructures must be put in place before any new modes of electricity generation or new methods of producing and distributing biofuels can begin to make a major difference in modern high-energy economies. Given the scale of national and global energy demand (for large countries 1011 W, globally nearly 15 TW in 2010, likely around 20 TW by 2025) and the cost and complexity of the requisite new infrastructures, there can be no advances in the structure and function of energy systems that are even remotely analogical to Moore’s progression of transistor packing."}
{"text": "Fossil fuel additions during that period thus amounted to about 2.83 Gtoe and they were roughly 57 times higher than the gain for all new renewables. Jefferson (2008) calls this rightly a very poor performance, but the contrast is not so sur- prising when the ﬁrst (already outlined) challenge of the coming transition— the magnitude of the global switch from fossil to renewable energies—is kept in mind. The achievement is, obviously, better as far as electricity is concerned, but even in that case the aggregate share for wind, geothermal, PV, and biomass-fueled generation reached just 3% of the total in 2008, wind generation accounting for half of that fraction, and with solar electricity remaining below 0.05% of the total."}
{"text": "Finally, I must emphasize the relatively slow rates of past and present transi- tions to new prime movers. This was the case for replacing draft animals by machines even in the United States, where it had taken more than halfa century to complete the transition from horses and mules to tractors and combines to internal combustion engines. Less surprisingly, poverty explains why the transi- tion from animate to inanimate prime movers in agriculture is yet to be com- pleted in many low-income nations: There are still some 500 million draft oxen, buffaloes, horses, donkeys, and camels, most of them in Asia and Africa. On national scales their aggregate capacity (roughly 200 GW) has become dwarfed by the power of agricultural machinery tractors and pumps but their work remains indispensable in many rural regions not only for ﬁeld work but also for local transportation."}
{"text": "Inertial reliance on the ﬁrst mechanical prime mover is best illustrated by a wartime example. By the time the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in Decem- ber 1941 there could be absolutely no doubt about the superiority of diesel engines in marine propulsion: First small ship engines were installed on river- going vessels in 1903, the ﬁrst diesel-powered vessel completed its intercontinen- tal voyage in 1911, and by 1940 a quarter of the world’s merchant ﬂeet, and practically all newly launched ships, had diesel engines (Smil, 2010b). But when the U.S. military needed the fastest possible delivery of a large number of trans- port ships the choice was made to go with steam propulsion. Between 1942 and 1945 U.S. and Canadian shipyards built 2,710 Liberty (EC2) class ships pow- ered by three-cylinder steam engines (each supplied by two oil-ﬁred boilers) rated at 1.86 MW (Bunker, 1972; Elphick, 2001). The ‘‘ships that won the war’’ thus used the prime mover introduced during the 1770s and perfected during the subsequent 100 years."}
{"text": "The only emerging rival of gasoline and diesel engines is the all-electric drive, but a long history of electric cars and repeated delays of their mass adoption make an imminent demise of the gasoline-fueled internal combustion engine highly unlikely. Technical breakthrough of another alternative, the fuel cell– powered drive, was prematurely touted as imminent during the late 1990s but the probability of near-term large-scale commercial adoption of vehicles pow- ered by hydrogen remains exceedingly low. An even more unlikely event is any early replacement of massive diesel engines that are used in heavy-duty road and rail transport and that almost completely dominate high-volume ocean ship- ping: There is simply no alternative to the machine, as no existing combustion engine can deliver the same service at a comparable cost and, no less importantly, at a similarly high reliability and durability."}
{"text": "Finally, most people would not think of steam turbines when asked to name the world’s most important continuously working prime mover. The machine was invented by Charles Parsons in 1884, it was much improved and widely commercialized before World War I, and it has remained fundamentally unchanged 125 years later: Gradual advances in metallurgy made it simply larger and more efﬁcient, but their pace has slowed signiﬁcantly since the late 1960s and the early 1970s when it reached its highest unit capacities in excess of 1 GW. The position of steam turbines as the world’s most powerful stationary prime mover is solidly entrenched: These machines now generate more than 70% of the world’s electricity in fossil-fueled and nuclear stations (the rest comes from gas and water turbines and diesels) and there is simply no alternative tech- nique of a similar capacity, efﬁciency, and reliability in sight. And there are no prospects for any near-term replacement of gas turbines used in ﬂight: There is simply no alternative to replace these prime movers that have dominated global air transportation since the 1960s."}
{"text": "NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS: GOALS AND REALITIES\n\nSubstitution goals are usually stated as shares of a particular energy supply to be provided by speciﬁed new energy conversions in future years (typically ending in zero or ﬁve) and are accepted by governments, although not necessarily as binding targets. Aspirations and perceived potentials are expressed in formal and informal forecasts, proposals, and scenarios produced by governments, industrial associations, nongovernmental organizations, and universities, and by frequent promises of campaigning politicians. Most of these goals and aspira- tions share a basic property, namely that they do not dwell on all those sobering, limiting, and complicating realities that were explained in the ﬁrst two sections of this chapter."}
{"text": "New operations received government subsidies of 10,000 SEK/ha at planting and in1998 the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency envisaged more than 100,000 ha of energy willows in production by 2005 and nearly 400,000 ha by 2020.Here are the prosaic realities of 2009.Sweden has no large-scale cultiva- tion of reeds for energy and no mass-production of pelletized reed phytomass. There has been a massive retreat from willow plantings:After a linear ascent to about 14,000 ha between 1989 and 1996 the further expansion of willow plant- ings had stopped—leaving the area at about 10%of the extent where it should have been by now—and some 40%of farmers have either retreated from willow cultivation or are regretting that they ever turned to that kind of silviculture."}
{"text": "And the country’s energy balances show that in 2008 all combustible renewable and wastes (dominated by wood) supplied less than 2% of all primary energy. And so it appears that this attempt to energize a modern society by coppiced willows (an image that invokes medieval landscapes of severely pruned trees) is not turning into a harbinger of things to come."}
{"text": "Given this history it is only fair to ask: Are today’s forecasts of anticipated, planned, or mandated shares of renewable energies as unrealistic as those of three decades ago? Jefferson (2008, p. 4116) gave a reasoned answer that covers all the major points: ‘‘Targets are usually too short term and clearly unrealistic ... sub- sidy systems often promote renewable energy schemes that are misdirected and buoyed up by grossly exaggerated claims. One or two mature energy technolo- gies are pushed nationally with insufﬁcient regard for their costs, contribution to electricity generation, transportation fuels’ needs, or carbon emission avoidance.’’\n\nI will illustrate these general observations by a number of prominent exam- ples. Two of the eight countries whose energy transitions were traced in this book’s previous chapter—oil-rich Saudi Arabia and hydrocarbon- and coal-rich Russia—have no (formal or informal) goals for using more renewable energy for domestic consumption. There is an academic project of renewable scenarios for Saudi Arabia (Al-Saleh, Upham, & Malik, 2008)—but the country’s oil min- ister warns against any rapid shift to renewables (because it may result in energy shortages once the global economy recovers) even as he expresses his hope that Saudi Arabia will become ‘‘the world’s largest exporter of clean electric energy produced from our abundant sunlight’’—but not for another 30 to 50 years (Patel, 2009)."}
{"text": "In contrast, Europe is the leader of renewable promises. The EU’s Second Stra- tegic Energy Review set ‘‘the ambitious objective of raising the share of renewable energy sources in its ﬁnal energy consumption from around 8.5% in 2005 to 20% in 2020’’ as ‘‘a necessary contribution to the ﬁght against climate change and the effort to diversify our energy mix’’ (CEC, 2008, p. 20). Because most of today’s renewable share consists of hydroelectricity, those member countries with minimal water power will ﬁnd that target extremely challenging as they would have to add new renewable capacities only in wind and solar electricity generation and in biofuels. But if the biofuel target will also include all aviation fuel, then it will be challenging for every EU state: The vision of every ﬁfth jet- liner powered by bio-kerosene by 2020 is surely a heady one! No matter, ‘‘green’’ activists are urging to aim far higher: For example, a report prepared by Friends of the Earth Scotland and WWF Scotland concluded that renewables (hydro, wind, waves, and geothermal) can supply 60% of the Scotland’s electricity by 2020 and 143% of the demand by 2030 (FOE Scotland, 2009)."}
{"text": "But, and despite the country’s weakening economic and strategic power, it will be the U.S. achievements that will prove or disprove the possibilities of an accelerated shift toward renewable conversions. Although the country has no formal government-mandated target for future renewable energy shares, it has no shortage of goals and proposals. The Utility Solar Assessment Study offered what it called ‘‘a comprehensive roadmap for utilities, solar companies, and regulators’’ to produce 10% ofU.S. electricity by PV generation by2025, agoal predicatedon costs below $3 per peak watt by 2018 and by substantial grid expansion (USA, 2008)."}
{"text": "Because wind-powered electricity generation is technically the most mature choice it is hardly surprising that most speciﬁc production targets refer to its future shares of electricity generation. The U.S. Department of Energy projected 20% of U.S. electricity generated by wind turbines by 2030, a goal requiring about 250 GW of new capacity on land and roughly 55 GW offshore (USDOE, 2008) . For comparison, the European Wind Energy Technology Platform, launched in 2006, is relatively slightly more ambitious, calling for 180 GW (including 40 GW offshore) by 2020 and 300 GW (half offshore), or about 25% of the EU’s electricity consumption, by 2030 (TPWind, 2008). But by far the most ambitious energy transition challenge for the United States was pre- sented by the country’s former vice president."}
{"text": "Gore’s bold goal called for ‘‘a strategic initiative designed to free us from the crises that are holding us down and to regain control of our own destiny’’: He challenged the nation ‘‘to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon-free sources within 10 years’’ and he thought that goal to be challenging but ‘‘achievable, affordable and trans- formative.’’ His conﬁdence was based on his expectation that ‘‘as the demand for renewable energy grows, the costs will continue to fall’’ and then he used the sil- icon analogy to explain the anticipated cost declines. I have already explained the completely misleading and entirely inappropriate choice of this analogy in the preceding section."}
{"text": "Here I will focus on another critical matter, on Gore’s unrealistic appraisal of technical and infrastructural possibilities. In 2008 the United States generated about 4 PWh of electricity with almost exactly one half coming from coal-ﬁred stations, 20% from nuclear ﬁssion, only a bit over 6% from hydro stations, and just 2.3% came from ‘‘new’’ renewables, that is, wind, geothermal, and solar (EIA, 2009). Because Gore wants to eliminate carbon-based electricity this would mean replacing 71% of the current generation originating in the combus- tion of fossil fuels. But if the country were to end up only with ‘‘renewable’’ means of electricity generation then the repowering should also affect the nuclear stations, whose operation emits no carbon but whose source of energy (ﬁssion- able isotopes) is obviously not renewable: Then the country would have to replace just over 90% of its current generation."}
{"text": "But those new capacities would be concentrated in the Great Plains (with wind power densities being the highest in their northern part) and in the South- west (with southern California, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico having the highest average insolation), and these regions have currently either only weak connections with the rest of the country or, for the most part, no major HV transmission links to major load centers on the East and West Coast at all. Repowering of the United States would thus have to be preceded by considerable rewiring, by creation of new, high-capacity, long-distance transmission links. This limited transmission capacity to move electricity from the new power cen- ters in the Southwest, Texas (Texas has its own grid weakly connected to the rest of the country), and the Midwest has been already delaying new wind projects even as wind generates less than 2% of all U.S. electricity. The United States now has about 265,000 km of HV lines, and at least 65,000 km of new high- capacity lines would be needed to rewire the nation, at an aggregate cost surpass- ing $100 billion."}
{"text": "Gore’s repowering plan was actually preceded by a more modest, but still very ambitious, plan advanced during the summer of 2008 by T. Boone Pickens, a Texas oilman, billionaire, and former corporate raider. His 10-year energy plan for United States had what I called an appealing ‘‘cascading simplicity’’ (Smil, 2008) . Pickens wanted to ﬁll the Great Plains (‘‘the Saudi Arabia of wind power’’) with wind turbines; this new wind power would replace all the electric- ity currently produced by burning natural gas. This natural gas freed by wind- powered generation would be used to run efﬁcient and clean natural gas vehicles. And this substitution would create new, massive, domestic aerospace-like indus- try (providing good jobs and bringing economic revival to the depopulating Great Plains) while cutting U.S. oil imports by more than one third and helping to put the country on a better ﬁscal foundation."}
{"text": "Pickens outlined the plan to the Congress and promoted it with a $58 million advertising blitz to rally public support (www.pickensplan.com). There is no argu- ing about the key reason behind the plan: Pickens rightly saw the U.S. addiction to oil, especially with the high prices ofthe summer 2008, as a threat to ‘‘our economy, our environment and our national security’’ that ‘‘ties our hands as a nation and a people.’’ But his plan would require building more than 100,000 wind turbines, connecting them to large cities with at least 65,000 km of transmission lines, and converting tens of millions of cars to natural gas fuel, a daunting task for a single decade. The plan proposed roughly $1 trillion in private investment to build the large wind farms and (conservatively estimated) another $200 billion in order to construct the requisite high-voltage transmission lines that would connect those giant wind farms to densely populated coastal regions."}
{"text": "Al Gore has not withdrawn or substantially modiﬁed his plan and his organi- zation (wecansolveit.org) went on to publish pathetic prayer-like advertisements imploring ‘‘our leaders’’ to ‘‘free us from our addiction to oil .. . Save us from this climate crisis .. . Give us 100% clean electricity within 10 years.’’ Pickens ﬁrst acknowledged that his grandiose plan has little chance to be realized any- time soon due to inadequate transmission links, late in 2008 he switched his vehicular gas proposal from passenger cars to trucks (because only about 1% of America’s ﬁlling stations are equipped to sell compressed natural gas), and by July 2009 the economic downturn led him to delay it: ‘‘I didn’t cancel it. Financ- ing is tough right now and so it’s going to be delayed a year or two’’ (Rascoe & O’Grady, 2009, p. 1). Even his own project, that was planned to be the world’s largest, 4-GW wind farm near Pampa in Texas, was set aside because the $4.9 bil- lion worth of the needed transmission lines will not pass all regulatory require- ments before 2013."}
{"text": "The Grand Energy Transition (GET) plan proposed by Robert Hefner, a life- long natural gas explorer and producer, amounts basically to the second part of the Pickens Plan, but with some other questionable provisos (Hefner, 2009)."}
{"text": "Hefner believes not only that U.S., and global, natural gas resources are larger than those of crude oil (a view shared by others) but that U.S. attainable gas reserves are as large or perhaps even larger than the country’s remaining minable coal deposits. Although the last claim may be too optimistic, the latest assess- ment by the Potential Gas Committee (2009) boosted the estimate of the U.S. gas resources by 39% compared to the 2006 total."}
{"text": "In any case, Hefner’s plan calls for retroﬁtting and converting half of the U.S."}
{"text": "vehicle ﬂeet to natural gas by the year 2020. He also believes that this would not be a difﬁcult conversion because a natural gas grid already extends to most of today’s urban gasoline ﬁlling stations as well as to some 63 million homes where more than 130 million vehicles could be ﬁlled with a convenient home-fueling appliance. According to Hefner this conversion would cut the oil imports by about 250 Mt/ year (in 2008 the country imported nearly 640 Mt), save trillions of dollars of foreign payments, trigger some $100 billion of private investment due to higher natural gas demand, and add some 100,000 new jobs. Actually the most important part of the GET plan that would unleash these massive changes is the elimination of taxes on labor and capital and their replacement with a ‘‘green’’ consumption tax to be levied initially on coal and oil products. Even if gas resources were super- abundant, an obvious question to ask concerns the likelihood of the U.S. Congress acting to eliminate all taxes on labor and capital."}
{"text": "I will note just one more of several recently issued sweeping proposals for reducing U.S. dependence on fossil fuels, Google’s plan to repower the United States that was released in October 2008, shortly after Gore’s challenge. Google’s Clean Energy 2030 called for ‘‘weaning the U.S. off of coal and oil for electricity generation by 2030 (with some remaining use of natural gas as well as nuclear), and cutting oil use for cars by 44%’’ (Google, 2008). This rapid energy transi- tion rests on three key steps. First, cutting the fossil fuel–based electricity gener- ation by 88%. Second, deploying aggressive end-use electrical energy efﬁciency in order to cut the anticipated 2030 demand by 33% and hence keep the overall demand ﬂat at the 2008 level. And, ﬁnally, by raising the sales of plug-in vehicles (hybrids and pure electrics) to 90% of all new car sales by 2030 and boosting the conventional vehicle efﬁciency to 45 mpg by 2030."}
{"text": "Based on the past experience and on the current baselines I conclude that keeping the nationwide electricity demand ﬂat at the 2008 level by 2030 and raising the average car performance to 45 mpg are technically eminently doable goals. Having plug-in vehicles taking over in just two decades is an entirely dif- ferent challenge, and eliminating nearly 90% of all fossil-fueled electricity gener- ation is a goal whose achievement is based on some unrealistic assumptions. The Google plan proposes to do that by eliminating all electricity produced by burn- ing coal and liquid fuels and about half of all electricity originating in gas-ﬁred stations: Their generation amounted to about 2.5 PWh in 2007 and they are to be replaced by 380 GW of new wind, 250 GW of new solar, and 80 GW of new geothermal capacity."}
{"text": "And turbogenerators in nuclear stations were added in unit capacities ranging from 300 MW to more than 1 GW!\n\nIn contrast, before large wind farms are assembled from hundreds of massive units their siting is subject to lengthy selection, environmental assessment, and approval process, and their completion (as Pickens so quickly discovered) must be preceded by the construction of requisite high-voltage transmission lines, a process that demands even lengthier route selection and regulatory approval. No less importantly, in order to generate 2.5 PWh of electricity, Google’s renew- able conversions would have to achieve average load factors of 35% for both wind and solar and 80% for geothermal generation. The last rate is realistic, the ﬁrst two are impossibly high as national means rather than as exceptional ratings."}
{"text": "Uncertainty regarding this key proﬁt-making assumption underscores a major failing of all of explicit transition plans or bold aspirations: Their goals might have a fair probability of success only if a concatenation of extraordi- narily advantageous circumstances and radical departures from prevailing modes of action (most often a strong government intervention) and resource valuation (be it the proposed carbon credits or life cycle assessment pricing) takes place. But the history of energy transitions makes it clear that many unexpected discontinuities have strongly affected the economic viability, public acceptance, and governmental support of new fuels and new conversion tech- niques and that they had changed, or even reversed, their adoption or diffusion rates."}
{"text": "Nuclear electricity generation is not the only prominent example of a rather sudden loss of faith in a new technique that was seen, for years or even decades, to offer an ultimate (or nearly so) solution before its sudden retreat. At the height of the second oil price crisis in the late 1970s it was the oil production from shales that was to save the United States, and that was supported by a huge commitment of federal monies: the Energy Security Act of 1980 budgeted $17 billion (with a further $68 billion to follow) in order to set a massive new industry producing two million barrels of oil from the Rocky Mountain shales by 1992, but the projected ﬁzzled out rapidly and was completely abandoned in 1985 after the oil prices collapsed."}
{"text": "Two decades later we were assured that within 10 years fuel cells will be the standard energizers of our road vehicles. Market value of Ballard Power Systems of Burnaby, BC, a principal developer of hydrogen-powered fuel cells, topped C$300/share in early 2000—but by the end of 2008 it stood at C$3/share and the company had abandoned any further development of hydrogen-fueled pro- pulsion and survives by selling fuel cells for forklifts and stationary units used for backup electricity generation."}
{"text": "In 1980 acid deposition (a problem largely eliminated by the combination of ﬂue gas desulfurization and switch to low-sulfur fuels, above all to natural gas) was the dominant environmental worry for the Western energy industries."}
{"text": "That concern hardly registers now, with the worries about global warming dwarﬁng all other environmental impacts of modern energy use."}
{"text": "The abrupt cessation of U.S. nuclear expansion is perhaps the best illustration of how exaggerated aspirations can end in outcomes that are a fraction of origi- nal goals (Smil, 2003). Expectations during the early 1970s were for annual capacity additions exceeding 50 GW in light water reactors beginning during the mid-1980s; at that time the ﬁrst liquid metal fast breeder reactors (LMFBR) were to make their commercial entry and by 1995 they, too, were expected to add 50 GW/year of new capacity, a combination that was to eliminate all fossil- fueled electricity generation before 1990. In reality, no new nuclear stations were ordered in the United States after 1978 and there is not a single operational LMFBR."}
{"text": "Given all of these uncertainties it is not surprising that the past performance of renewable conversions cannot be used to prime quantitative models of their future advances. The key problem with this approach is that there is not a single growth curve to follow. Growth and diffusion of most phenomena—including energy resource substitutions and adoption of new fuel and electricity conversion techniques—is a process that almost inevitably follows a progression that is dis- tinguished with its slow initial advances followed by a rapid rise, an eventual inﬂection point, and rapidly declining increments towards saturation. However, when complete or nearly complete substitution or diffusion processes are studied retroactively, some of them are found to conform to a logistic equation while others are best ﬁtted with its variants including, most notably, Gompertz, Weibull, and hyperlogistic distribution (Banks, 1994)."}
{"text": "The second chapter offered a truly long-term historical perspective by survey- ing the grand energy transitions from biomass to fossil fuels and from animate power to mechanical prime movers and the rise of electricity, the most ﬂexible form of all energies. Availability of reasonably good statistics of global energy use augmented by serviceable estimates of preindustrial performance made it pos- sible to conclude the chapter with revealing quantiﬁcations of these long-term shifts in resources and prime movers. The record on the global scale is unequivo- cal: All of the past shifts to new sources of primary energy have been gradual, pro- longed affairs, with new sources taking decades from the beginning of production to become more than insigniﬁcant contributors, and then another two to three decades before capturing a quarter or a third of their respective markets."}
{"text": "And surveying the rise of the currently dominant prime movers reveals, yet again, incremental ascents with decades elapsing between the ﬁrst technical break- throughs and the conquest of signiﬁcant shares of respective markets. In addition, the record of modern prime mover development suggests a remarkably high degree of persistence as the machines that have been with us for more than 100 years (gasoline- and diesel-fueled internal combustion engines, steam turbines, electric motors) or for three generations (gas turbines) not only continue the dominance of their respective niches but do not appear to be threatened by any new tech- niques promising their rapid displacement."}
{"text": "Among the new renewable conversions, wind-powered electricity generation stands out due to its recent rapid technical maturation, declining cost and rising unit capacities (MW-sized turbines), annual additions (GW-sized), and overall sys- tem capabilities (tens of GW in several countries). Wind-powered electricity gener- ation is thus at the forefront of the unfolding energy transition and there is no doubt that countries with particularly windy climates can generate not just 20% but 30% of their electricity using large wind turbines (Zubi, Bernal-Augustn, & Marn, 2009)—particularly if they are relatively small and are already well con- nected to grids of adequate capacity or if the construction of new links precedes the commitment to higher rates of wind-driven generation. Denmark—where wind generated almost 20% of all electricity in 2007 and where large offshore proj- ects are to raise the share to 50% by 2025—is a foremost example of this combina- tion: It has a relatively small market (total generating capacity is less than 10 GW) and excellent interconnections with the hydro-rich Scandinavia to the north and with large thermal systems in Germany and beyond to the south."}
{"text": "But the challenge is different in large countries whose wind resources are concentrated far from major load centers (North Dakota is 2,600 km from New York, in European terms more than the distance between Paris and Moscow) and where extensive, and expensive, up-front investment in new high-voltage transmission links will be needed if the shares of wind electricity are to surpass 15% or 20%. Load factors will have to get better than the recent worldwide mean of only about 20% and typical national means of less than 25%—but the best way to raise them, by setting up large wind farms offshore, has its own problems, ranging from high construction costs to increased mainte- nance and lower durability of components set in extreme environments."}
{"text": "And as with all technical innovations, a deﬁnite judgment regarding long- term capability and reliability of wind-driven or PV generation is still many years ahead. Decades of cumulative experience are needed to assess properly all of the risks and beneﬁts entailed in large-scale operation of these new systems and to quantify satisfactorily their probabilities of catastrophic failures and their true lifetime costs. This means that we will be able to offer it only after very large numbers of large-capacity units will have accumulated at least two decades of operating experience in a wide variety of conditions. This ultimate test of long-term dependence and productivity will be particularly critical for massive offshore wind farms or for extensive PV ﬁelds in harsh desert environment."}
{"text": "Future levels of production and adoption of renewably produced fuels have no less uncertain prospects. The best Brazilian sugar cane–based practices aside, the current ways of relatively large-scale ethanol crop–based production cannot be—due to the combination of high energy costs, serious environmental impacts, and major effects on food prices—a basis for an industry producing liquid transportation fuels at scales that would cut the demand for reﬁned fuels by substantial (at least 20–25%) shares. What has been achieved so far (ethanol and biodiesel) has come about as a result of very large and very questionable subsidies (Steenblik, 2007). And all of those repeatedly extolled options based on waste cellulosic substrates (crop and forest residues) or on large-scale cultiva- tion of high-yielding species (switchgrass, miscanthus, jatropha) has yet to reach even the minimal threshold of large-scale commercial viability and hence they should not be seen as imminent and reliable providers of alternative fuels."}
{"text": "And in all cases the renewable energy enthusiasts do not sufﬁciently recognize the challenge of converting the existing (and basically a century old) system based on centralized extraction and conversion of energies with very high power densities to a system based on harnessing low power density ﬂows to be used in relatively high power density urban areas. Decentralized energy provision, a holy grail of true green believers, is ﬁne for a farmstead or a small town, not for the large cities that already house most of the world’s humanity and even less so for megacities (such as today’s Tokyo, Shanghai, or Mumbai) where most of the world’s population will live by 2050."}
{"text": "Because I have always preferred unruly realities to neat simpliﬁcations I have always had my doubts about the efﬁcacy of supposedly revelatory models and, as I have demonstrated, the record of past energy transitions justiﬁes this skepticism. And the economics of the entire energy supply offers no ﬁrm guid- ance either. After more than a century of coal-ﬁred electricity generation we have internalized some of its key externalities (from enhanced mining safety to ﬂue gas desulfurization) but we still have not accounted for the long-term cost of its NOx and above all CO2 emissions. After more than half a century of living with nuclear power we still dispute its real cost (including the near-perpetual guardianship of long-lived wastes), and this uncertainty is a key reason why most of today’s visions of non-fossil futures do not feature mass-scale nuclear generation."}
{"text": "Consequently, all cost comparison and all claims of imminent investment or price parities or advantages should not be mistaken for decisive guides. And the situation is, if anything, even shakier with the claims of future competitive costs of wind-generated or PV electricity, or capital estimates for future wave or ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) stations or algal megaﬂows: All those claims and counterclaims depend on concatenated assumptions whose true details are often impossible to ascertain, on uncertain choices of amortization periods and discount rates, and all of them are contaminated by (past, present, and tacitly expected) tax breaks, government subsidies, and simplistic, mechanis- tic assumptions regarding the future decline of unit costs. One might think that repeated cost overruns and chronically unmet forecasts of capital or operating costs should have had some effect, but they have done little to stop the recitals of new dubious numbers."}
{"text": "That a lengthy process of maturation, perfection, diffusion, and widespread commercial adoption of new renewable conversions will require government interventions is not at all surprising, as none of the other innovations in the recent history of energy advances has done without it. But the very necessity of such interventions—particularly if they were to become excessively concentrated in one or two areas, or if a panicky assessment were to lead to unusually large ‘‘crisis’’ investment—raises the obvious questions regarding the continuity of policies under different governments, resilience of ofﬁcial policies during the period of highly ﬂuctuating or precipitously declining prices, and the capacity to sustain high levels of investment/subsidies/tax preferences during the period of severe and prolonged economic crises."}
{"text": "Moreover, inherent constraints and complications accompanying large-scale commercial harnessing of renewable energies would only tend to make this new epochal transition an even more challenging and very likely a much more protracted affair than is commonly assumed. Unfortunately, common expec- tations of energy futures—shared not only by poorly informed enthusiasts and careless politicians but, inexplicably, by too many uncritical professionals—have been, for decades, resembling more science ﬁction than unbiased engineering, economic, and environmental appraisals. The list of seriously espoused energy ‘‘solutions’’ has run from that ultimate fata morgana of nuclear fusion to an irre- pressible (and always commencing in a decade or so) hydrogen economy, and its prominent entries have included everything from liquid metal fast breeder reac- tors to squeezing 5% of oil from the Rocky Mountain shales."}
{"text": "And so (yet again) nihil novi sub sole, as today’s renewable list contains such ‘‘solutions’’ as mass deployment of bobbing wave converters in coastal waters, ﬂexible PV ﬁlms enveloping houses (and even people), enormous solar panels unfolded from satellites in stationary orbits, algae disgorging high-octane gaso- line by hundreds of millions of liters a year, or (one of the latest favorites) ingenious harnessing of jet streams’ ferocious winds 12 km above the ground (Archer & Caldeira, 2009; Vance, 2009). Those readers of this book who are no older than their early forties will have an excellent chance to see how many of these energy salvations will become commercial ubiquities by 2050."}
{"text": "This grand solar subsidy, this still-intensifying depletion of an energy stock whose beginnings go back hundreds of millions of years, cannot last, and the tran- sition to a non-fossil future is an imperative process of self-preservation for modern high-energy civilization. While I am skeptical about many exaggerated, unwar- ranted claims regarding the pace and the near-term exploits of new renewable con- versions, I remain hopeful in the long run. The ﬁrst grand energy transition, the mastery of ﬁre, has been one of the great accomplishments that set the hominins irretrievably apart from the rest of the mammalian kingdom. The second grand energy transition, from foraging to sedentary cropping and domestication of animals, gave us eventually high cultures and led to historical consciousness and, millennia later, to the doorstep of the modern world."}
{"text": "At that time all three major kinds of fossil fuels were being extracted by increas- ingly efﬁcient methods, electricity generation was spreading light and mechanical power in large cities, and most major components of the modern energy system (including large mines, drilling rigs, reﬁneries, pipelines, tankers, and power plants) were in place. But the industrial practices, household and transportation energy uses, and the behavior of the entire energy system in 1900 would have been poor predictors of future accomplishments: there was no gasoline and no mass ownership of cars, there was electricity but barely any household appliances, there was energy-intensive chemical industry but no synthesis of ammonia, now (when compared on a molar basis) the single most important synthetic product and a key reason why the planet can feed seven billion people. And, of course, there was no ﬂight, no gas turbines, no nuclear generation, and not a single item of consumer electronics."}
{"text": "And while we cannot outline complex outcomes of the unfolding transition, we can learn a great deal from the general features of process that got us through the past energy transitions. Inevitably, all past energy transitions have stimulated technical advances and provided unprecedented opportunities for our inventive- ness. All of them posed, inevitably, enormous challenges for both producers and consumers of new forms of energy; all of them required the abandonment of old components, habits, and activities; all of them necessitated the rise of new infra- structures and reorganization of existing ways of production and transportation; all of them were costly and protracted; and all of them caused major socioeco- nomic dislocations."}
{"text": "All of them had also eventually created more productive and richer economies and improved the overall quality of life—and this experience should be eventu- ally replicated by the coming energy transition. There has been a widespread agreement that the new transition must be accompanied, indeed made less tax- ing, by higher efﬁciency of energy use. No doubt, a more vigorous pursuit of higher energy efﬁciency for common converters should be an essential accompa- niment of the unfolding energy transition, and it should consist of an organic mixture of adopting proven superior techniques and promoting bold innova- tions that would result in major efﬁciency gains throughout the economy. Fortu- nately, possibilities of such gains remain no less promising today than they appeared two generations ago: This energy transition toward more rational energy use can continue for decades to come."}
{"text": "But better conversion efﬁciencies alone are not enough, they will just keep conﬁrm- ing a lasting truth of Jevons’s venerable paradox that ‘‘it is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth’’ (Jevons, 1865, p. 140). The second precondition of a successful new transition in all afﬂuent nations must be to avoid consuming more energy more efﬁciently, and this means that by far the most impor- tant step that those countries should take are gradual but signiﬁcant overall reduc- tions of energy use. High-income economies now account for less than 20% of humanity but they claim half of all commercial energy; the United States alone, with about 4.5% of all people, consumes just over 20% of the world’s fossil fuels and primary electricity. In per capita terms Americans now consume more than twice as much energy as do the citizens of the largest European economies (Germany and France) or Japan (8.5 vs. about 4.2 toe per capita)."}
{"text": "U.S. energy consumption is not only much higher than in any other afﬂuent economy (a reality that would make it easier to reduce it without compromising the prevailing quality of life), but the country’s average per capita use of primary energy in 2010 (8.2 toe) was about 5% lower than in 1980 and no higher than in 1970! Given this reality, it is obvious that if more responsible residential zoning reg- ulations and more demanding automotive efﬁciency standards had been in place the United States could have prevented the emergence of energy-expensive exurbia and the fuel wasted due to the worsening car performance, and the average per cap- ita energy consumption could have been gradually declining. And Europe, despite its lower per capita consumption, could have also done better: Germany’s per capita energy use has remained ﬂat for a generation, but the British rate has been margin- ally up and the French use in 2010 was nearly 20% higher than in 1980."}
{"text": "Deliberate pursuit of gradual reductions of per capita energy consumption use is both desirable and achievable but it will have to be a gradual process last- ing for decades and it could not succeed without redeﬁning many entrenched practices used to measure and to judge fundamental energy realities and policies. One of its most important preconditions would be to discard the misleadingly incomplete ways of valuing goods and services without appraising their real costs (including environmental as well as strategic and health burdens) and without judging their beneﬁt by using life cycle analyses. Although none of these ideas guides today’s economic thinking, substantial intellectual foundation for such more comprehensive valuations is already in place."}
{"text": "Energy transitions have been, and will continue to be, inherently prolonged affairs, particularly so in large nations whose high levels of per capita energy use and whose massive and expensive infrastructures make it impossible to greatly accelerate their progress even if we were to resort to some highly effective interventions. The overall composition of primary energy supply and the princi- pal modes of energy conversions will closely resemble today’s arrangements ﬁve or ten years from now—but how far we will advance into the post-fossil future in three or four decades will not be determined only by the commitment to innovation but also by our willingness to moderate our energy expectations and to have our energy uses following a more sensible direction, one that would combine reduced demand with a difﬁcult, but eventually rewarding, quest for a civilization powered by renewable energy ﬂows."}

Peter Street probably cut the new timber for the enlargement in a forest near Windsor, west of London, lopped and topped and barked and shaped it there to avoid the cost of barging whole trees down the Thames. A Swiss tourist, Thomas Platter, attended a production ofJulius Caesar in the new Globe on the afternoon of 21 September 1599, so it was up and running by then. He thought the play “quite aptly performed.”2\n\nElizabethan England was a country built of wood. “The greatest part of our building in the cities and good towns of England,” the Elizabethan observer William Harrison reported in 1577, “consisteth only of timber.”3 Even the country’s implements, its plows and hoes, were wooden, if iron edged. London was a wooden city, peak-roofed and half-timbered, heating itself with Йrewood burned on stone hearths called reredos raised in the middle of rooms, the sweet wood smoke drifting through the house and out the windows."}

King Charles II had been restored to the throne on his thirtieth birthday, 29 May 1660, and the traitor Oliver Cromwell’s head pickled and mounted on a pike on London Bridge after a seventeen-year interregnum bloodied with regicide and civil war; Evelyn’s vision of a refreshed and healthier London drew as well on his renewed sense ofpublic order."}

It would also, Evelyn added, give employment to “thousands of able Watermen” delivering the products of industry upriver into the city, would free up “Places and Houses” within the city for conversion into “Tenements, and some of them into Noble Houses for use and pleasure” with attractive river views. (Urban renewal and gentriЙcation have ancient antecedents.) Moving industry to the suburbs would help prevent Йres as well, Evelyn concluded. He thought accidental Йres originated in “places where such great and exorbitant Fires are perpetually kept going.”36 London in the year of Fumifugium’s Йrst publication, 1661, was indeed only Йve years away from her Great Fire of 1666, which burned out all the city within the old medieval walls. That Йre, however, started in a bakery."}
{"text": "As coal replaced wood in domestic heating and in industry, and as the British population grew, colliers sought deeper seams. A coal seam in Britain might range in thickness from a few inches up to a rare thirty feet. It might lay underground anywhere from a fathom or two—six to twelve feet—to eight hundred feet or more. It might run parallel to the surface or slant upward or downward. Water might Мow through it or through porous strata above or below it. Often it harbored pockets or channels ofnoxious or explosive gas."}
{"text": "Exploring involved either sinking or boring, often both. Sinking meant digging a mine shaft six feet across with pick and shovel, with a windlass above ground to draw up the waste under a canvas to keep out the rain. Underground water and quicksand challenged the colliers, who might line the shaft with timbers sealed with earth or clay or packed with unshorn sheepskins."}
{"text": "After each drop,the colliers rotated the chisel a quarter turn to make the hole round.Every six inches or so,the string had to be pulled to resharpen the chisel and check for traces of coal—an increasingly laborious chore as the hole deepened.If pulverized rock(\"wreck,\"colliers called it1)clogged the hole,the men pulled the string and replaced the chisel with a screw-threaded auger to clear it.Through hard rock,a yard a day was considered good progress.Finding deep coal seams might require a year or more,the colliers paid at higher rates as the drill string lengthened and the work got harder.2 If the borehole found a coal seam,it had to be enlarged to a mine shaft with pick and shovel."}
{"text": "“The phenomenon of people being shot out of pits,” writes the Victorian mining engineer Robert Galloway, “. . . was a frequent, indeed almost regular concomitant of early colliery explosions of any magnitude.”7 One of the more spectacular occurred in 1675 in Mostyn, Wales, on the Dee River, southeast of Liverpool. When the mine opened in 1640, the miners worked out a system for suppressing the Йredamp at the beginning of each workday by sending one of their number ahead with a cluster of lit candles mounted on the end of a long pole to Йre the night’s accumulation. They called him the Йreman. He wore old sackcloth overclothes, water-soaked for protection. “As the Мame ran along the roof,” Galloway writes, “the Йreman lay Мat on the Мoor of the mine till it passed over him.”8 Ventilation prevented methane from accumulating during the day, and the next morning the Йreman repeated his risky detonation."}
{"text": "By 1675, the Mostyn mine had been worked for more than three decades. Then the owners decided to sink a pit into a parallel coal seam lower down. This Йfty-foot blind pit Йlled with Йredamp. Firing it, Galloway reports, produced an “alarmingly violent” explosion.9 Worse was yet to come."}
{"text": "Horse gins hauled water up the mine shaft in buckets. They hauled corves of coal as well. Galloway says the system was both limited and expensive: horses had to be bought or bred and raised, fed, and maintained. “In some instances, as many as Йfty horses were employed in raising water at a single colliery”—at an expense, Galloway estimates, of not less than £900 a year (today £113,600, or $169,000). Deeper mines, impossible to drain with horsepower alone, had to be abandoned. Drowned mines, lost capital, lost work opened a space for invention."}
{"text": "Discoveries in science prepared the way. That the atmosphere has weight had been known since the 1643 experiments of Galileo’s protégé Evangelista Torricelli. Torricelli’s experiments led to the invention of the mercury-column barometer, which responds to changes in air pressure—that is, to changes in the density of the column of air above the instrument. The Prussian engineer Otto von Guericke demonstrated the force of the atmosphere in 1654 in a famous public exhibition before Emperor Ferdinand III at Regensburg. Von Guericke pumped out the air in two copper hemispheres and mounted the resulting evacuated sphere between eight teams of horses. Only atmospheric pressure held the two hemispheres together, but the straining teams of horses could not pull them apart."}

{"text": "Though he was living by then in Oxford,Boyle turned to Ralph Greatrex,a London instrument maker of reputation.Greatrex proved unable to construct a workable air pump.An Oxford don who lectured in chemistry pointed Boyle to the young but ingenious Robert Hooke,twenty-three years old in 1658 and the don's laboratory assistant.Boyle hired Hooke to help him,and after several unsuccessful attempts using other people's designs,Hooke designed a vacuum pump that worked.It was a first-generation instrument,leaky and slow,but for Boyle it served to begin experimenting."}
{"text": "Boyle's pump and his subsequent vacuum experiments not only demonstrated that a vacuum could be created and studied and had distinctive properties (extinguishing candles,transmitting light but not sound).It also revealed the force of air pressure:the weight of the atmosphere above and surrounding us as we go about our lives.\"There is a Spring,or Elastical power,\" Boyle wrote,\"in the Air we live in.\"13 The question then became how to harness such a powerful force at larger scale,outside the laboratory."}
{"text": "Men had been experimenting with using heat to make partial vacuums since at least the beginning of the seventeenth century.A Dutchman,Cornelius Drebbel,invented a simple mechanism for applying fire to draw water in 1604, one he later illustrated in a book."}
{"text": "Drebbel described hanging a retort—a gourd-shaped metal container—over a fire with its mouth submerged in a bucket of water.As the fire heated the retort, the air inside would expand and bubble out through the water.Withdraw the fire,and the air remaining in the retort would cool,contracting and forming a partial vacuum.Ambient air pressure would then drive water from the bucket into the underwater mouth of the retort.Drebbel's simple pump had potential. Enlarged and engineered further,it might draw water from a river,for example, to supply a community."}
{"text": "Drebbel,\"a very light-haired and handsome man,\"according to one courtier who met him,\"and of very gentle manners,\"14 produced other inventions as well:from fountain mechanisms to a barometric“perpetual-motion”display popular with royalty.15 In 1605 he traveled to London as a tutor to Henry Frederick,Prince of Wales,James I's eldest son.Word of his inventive gifts spread across Europe,bringing Continental nobles to London to observe him at work.When the Holy Roman Emperor,Rudolf IⅡ,invited Drebbel to Prague,though he might have preferred to remain in England,he had little choice but to accept the invitation.Rudolfs death in 1612 liberated him. Unfortunately,the Prince of Wales died that year as well,at eighteen,of typhoid fever.Drebbel finally returned to James I's service in England in 1613."}

{"text": "Leibniz,who had corresponded with Von Guericke,had already written a report on the Prussian engineer's vacuum demonstration for another member of the French academy.21 The gunpowder engine that he and Papin now constructed for Huygens represented another way to turn atmospheric pressure into mechanical work:a small charge of gunpowder exploded below a piston inside a thick-walled metal cylinder that blew some of the air out of the cylinder through flap valves,creating a partial vacuum.Outside air pressure on the open- ended piston then drove it farther into the cylinder.If the piston was attached to a rod or a cable,objects connected to those extensions would move."}
{"text": "Huygens moved on to inventing the mainspring-driven pocket watch and, a few years later, postulating the Йnite velocity of light. Leibniz crossed to London, where, despite election to the Royal Society, he continued his frustrating search for a secure position that might allow him time to work on philosophy. Papin, the physician-turned-engineer, recognizing the increasing risk of living as a Huguenot in Catholic France, moved to London in 1675. A letter of endorsement from Huygens recommended him to Robert Boyle, who had lost Hooke’s services to London’s Gresham College and to the Royal Society. Never a hands-on experimenter, Boyle hired Papin as his laboratory assistant."}

{"text": "At Marburg, Papin continued his experiments. In the late 1680s, observing that water occupies more than a thousand times its previous volume when it turns to steam, he decided that steam rather than gunpowder was the better working medium for his engine."}
{"text": "“Since it is a property ofwater,” he wrote in 1690, “that a small quantity ofit, converted into steam by the force of heat, has an elastic force like that of the air”—that is, expands and pushes against the walls of its container—“but, when cold supervenes, is again resolved into water, so that no trace of the said elastic force remains; I felt conЙdent that machines might be constructed, wherein water, by means of no very intense heat, and at small cost, might produce that perfect vacuum which had failed to be obtained by aid ofgunpowder.”26\n\nPapin was proposing to use steam to Йll the cylinder, pushing up the piston to its highest position, and then hold the piston there with a latch while the cylinder cooled and the steam condensed back into water, losing most of the volume it had previously occupied. If he kept the cylinder sealed oА from the air, the condensing steam would leave a vacuum in its place. Release the latch, and the full force of the atmosphere would push down the piston to Йll the vacuum, pulling along whatever might be attached to it. Several such units operating together, like the cylinders in a modern automobile engine strung along a crankshaft, might produce a steady output ofpower."}
{"text": "While teaching at Marburg, Papin married his widowed cousin and added responsibility for her extended family to his burdens. He turned to Huygens for help in Йnding a better-paying position. Perhaps as a result, in 1695 he received appointment as a counselor to the landgraveII of Hesse-Kassel, the closest he ever came to acquiring a noble patron. Unfortunately, Landgrave Moritz wasn’t interested in Йnancing an iron foundry or a factory for Papin’s atmospheric engine. Instead, he wanted fountains in his gardens like those at Versailles."}
{"text": "When new technologies falter, reverting to earlier, more dependable systems can sometimes ease the transition, combining the old with the new. The earlier, commercially successful steam engine for mine drainage succeeded by retreating from such ambitious designs as those of Papin and Savery. If the craft skills of the day were inadequate to produce boilers capable of containing high- pressure steam, part of the answer to raising water by Йre was to make use of steam only at atmospheric pressure, condensing it to create the partial vacuum of the atmospheric engine. Thomas Newcomen, a Devonshire ironmonger, pursued that path beginning around 1700."}
{"text": "Ironmongers in that era not only sold hardware but also crafted it—tools in particular. Making and selling tools carried Newcomen into the tin mines of Devon and Cornwall. Like England’s coal mines, its tin mines were being extended deeper underground as more superЙcial veins of tin ore were exhausted. By the turn of the eighteenth century, Мooded mines had become a serious problem, and pumping them dry with horse sweeps was expensive. The anonymous author F. C., a miner, estimated in his The Compleat Collier, published in 1708, that “dry collieries would save several thousand pounds per annum which is expended in drawing water hereabouts.”14 Newcomen was responding to a lucrative opportunity."}
{"text": "So far,so good.But pouring water over the cylinder to cool it from the outside was still relatively slow,limiting the power output.Newcomen's early design was much less efficient than it could be,though more efficient than Savery's."}
{"text": "Unfortunately for Newcomen, Thomas Savery had written his 1698 patent so broadly that it covered all engines that raised water by Йre, and Parliament in 1699 had extended the Savery patent for an additional twenty-one years beyond the original fourteen, to 1733. Having no other choice, Newcomen partnered with Savery, an arrangement that continued after Savery died in 1715 with a joint-stock company formed to exploit the Savery patent, the Proprietors ofthe Invention for Raising Water by Fire.21 The proprietors issued eighty shares, of which Newcomen was awarded twenty."}
{"text": "Coal moved locally in carts or in panniers on packhorses, but it was shipped by river and near shore to London. As mine owners devised methods ofЙnding coal and then of draining Мooded mines, output increased accordingly. Mines adjacent to rivers depleted, and new pits had to be opened farther inland. Two new problems arose: negotiating wayleave fees with landowners for crossing their property in a countryside of limited and primitive public roads; and moving the coal from the pithead to the river."}
{"text": "Iron had long been reduced from ore and puriЙed with wood charcoal rather than mineral coal—pit coal—because the sulfur in coal embrittles iron. But the continuing scarcity of wood had begun to restrict the growth of British industry. At the same time, the market was glutted with coal because industrial coal use was limited to boiling operations such as salt boiling and cloth dyeing. As British industry expanded, there simply wasn’t enough wood in all ofBritain to meet the demand for iron.45 Cracking the hard nut of smelting iron with coal had challenged British inventors and entrepreneurs for a hundred years."}

{"text": "Watt continued living on the Glasgow campus and operating his shop while learning and experimenting. If he had little knowledge of steam machinery in 1758, he soon had reason to acquire more: in 1760, Glasgow’s newly appointed professor of natural philosophy, John Anderson, eight years Watt’s senior, hired him to maintain the laboratory instruments and models that Anderson would be using to teach physics and chemistry.11 (Anderson was an enthusiastic teacher; his students called him “Jolly Jack Phosphorus.”12) He paid Watt Йve pounds Йve shillings in June of that year, probably as a retainer. The day prior to that payment order, another had been issued for £2 to cover the cost of picking up a model Newcomen engine from a London instrument maker, Jonathan Sisson.13 Watt served Anderson not only by maintaining instruments and models but also as a demonstrator. He probably operated the Newcomen model for lecture hall demonstrations."}
{"text": "Many years later, Watt recalled that he “went on with some detached experiments on steam until 1763.”14 He said that diАerently in 1769, when he wrote that between 1761 and 1763, he “tried some experiments on the force of steam in a Papin’s digester.”15 Watt described only one of his experiments in detail, but it’s clear that he conducted a number of steam experiments during the period when he was working with Anderson."}
{"text": "At that point, John Robison returned to Glasgow from navy duty, and the two friends picked up where they had left oА.21 Discussing the faulty Newcomen model, Watt recalls, they concluded that if the cylinder were made of wood rather than metal, the device would lose much less heat. Watt had resolved by then “to improve the machine,” he says—not only Anderson’s model but also, after three years of informal study and experiment, the Newcomen engine itself. It was grossly ineГcient, and there was wide scope for improvement. “I always thought the machine might be applied to other as valuable purposes as drawing water,” Watt testiЙes in his notebook.22 Robison had ventured one of those purposes: transportation. The numerous British iron foundries and woolen mills presently dependent upon unreliable water power might also operate better on steam."}
{"text": "But with a vacuum now in both cylinder and condenser,how were the cold injection water,the air that came in with it,and the condensed steam to be drained for the next cycle?Watt thought of two ways,one involving a long drain pipe sunk into the ground below the engine.But the method he chose was to pump out the dregs with an air pump.A long drainpipe would limit where the engine could be sited.A pump could go anywhere."}
{"text": "Watt's original model separate condenser."}
{"text": "“Well,” Brown asked him, “have you seen Jamie Watt?” Robison said he had. Brown said Watt must be in high spirits. Robison agreed that he was. “Gad,” Brown went on, eager to share the news, “the condenser’s the thing: keep it but cold enough, and you may have a perfect vacuum, whatever be the heat of the cylinder.” Then Robison got it: keeping the cylinder hot, exhausting the steam, the separate condenser: “The whole Мashed on my mind at once.”36\n\nRobison pumped Brown for more information. He learned that Watt was having trouble preventing the cylinder from leaking steam. Watt had tried both leather and felt, but neither could withstand the heat. That was clearly a problem yet to be solved. The important point, Robison decided, was that Watt was using steam to work his engine, not relying simply on air pressure."}

{"text": "Already in the 1790s,a young engineer named Richard Trevithick Jr.,born in Cornwall in 1771,had begun to develop a different kind of steam engine."}
{"text": "Trevithick, whose father was a mine captain, agent, and engineer, was a giant of a man by the standards of the day. At six foot two, rawboned and muscular, he was strong enough to draw crowds when he demonstrated lifting a blacksmith’s mandrel, a thousand-pound cone of cast iron. Once, at a public dinner, he picked up a sturdy six-foot colleague, rotated him upside down and stamped his boot prints onto the ceiling. Such exploits earned him the nickname “the Cornish Giant.” Besides an imposing physical presence, Trevithick was gifted at building steam engines, usually introducing innovations that increased their eГciency. In 1795, when Boulton & Watt enjoined an atmospheric engine Trevithick built at Ding Dong mine in Cornwall for interfering with its patents, the young engineer responded by rebuilding the machine, inverting its big cylinder, removing the cylinder cover, and foregoing the beneЙts of Watt’s separate condenser."}
{"text": "Dashed lines on engine body indicate U-shaped firebox inside,opening to right beside smokestack.Pipe above and paralleling engine body from piston to stack feeds waste steam to draw air through firebox."}
{"text": "The extended demonstration ofTrevithick’s common road steam locomotive turned up no investors interested in supporting its further development. The Cornish Giant concluded that the future of the steam engine wasn’t transporting people but working machinery and hauling coal. He set his engines to work boring brass cannon, pumping water, and blowing furnaces."}
{"text": "Even before the London demonstration, Trevithick had run short of money. A wealthy businessman, Samuel Homfray, ironmaster of the Penydarren Ironworks at Merthyr TydЙl in South Wales, rescued him, buying a quarter of the high-pressure patent for £10,000 (today £800,000, or $1.1 million).41 If Boulton and Watt saw no future in high-pressure steam, Homfray did."}
{"text": "Several secondary technologies came together at this point as well. Most tramways were now railed with cast-iron rails set on stone blocks. They were not yet linked with what Americans call “crossties” and English call “sleepers,” because the space between the rails had to be left open as a path where the horses could walk to pull the wagons. The rails themselves were now Мanged, with a raised rim on the inside edge to hold the iron wheels on the track. Flanging, of either the rails or the wheels, is the reason why locomotives don’t have steering wheels: the Мanging does the steering, guiding the wheels along."}
{"text": "Once the roadbed had been reinforced,Trevithick began selling one-shilling (today f4,or$6)rides on his train.A reliable observer,an engineer named John Hawkins,recalled timing his ride at twelve miles per hour—about the speed ofa trotting horse—and hearing Trevithick claim Catch me who can would be good for twenty mph or more on a straight track.Hawkins speaks of\"a ride for the few who were not too timid,\"suggesting that many were.Riding in an open car pulled by a strange,wheezing,smoke-belching black-iron contraption with a fire in its belly,feeling an unfamiliar centrifugal force around the continuously curving circular track,fearing an accident or an explosion,would make most people timid.\"It ran for some weeks,\"Hawkins concludes to the point,\"when a rail broke and occasioned the engine to fly off in a tangent and overturn,the ground being very soft at the time.\"No record survives of any twenty-four- hour mileage contest against a racehorse."}
{"text": "Once again, infrastructure had set a limit on the pace of development of a new technology. But by the second decade of the nineteenth century, malleable- iron rails were beginning to replace brittle cast iron on the wagonways of England, and stone or wooden sleepers strengthened the roadbeds for heavy locomotives. With such improvements, Trevithick’s circular track on vacant land in London would open out into a network of fast, reliable transportation —but not before its inventors and engineers endured a Йnal long haul of challenges and trials."}

{"text": "“The steam engine meant that coal could be exploited to supply mechanical energy as readily as heat energy,” writes the economic historian E. A. Wrigley, “thus overcoming the last remaining barrier to the application of fossil-fuel energy to all the main productive processes.”1 For William Blake, that newfound mechanical energy, turning drive belts and working looms, might culminate in “dark satanic mills.” The continuing increase of the British population, from 6 million in 1700 to 10.5 million in 1801, suggests a more optimistic outcome. Coal provided about half of British domestic energy in 1700, but such was the growth of industry across the eighteenth century that the share of coal used for domestic heating and cooking had dropped to less than one-third by 1800 even as total consumption had greatly increased."}
{"text": "Anderson’s vision of a world made generous and peaceful with technology parallels Wordsworth’s vision of manmade beauty as nature’s equal. Both visions celebrate the new, energy-rich world just then emerging and discount the associated smoke pollution and debilitating mining and factory labor.

And, concluding, “the whole country would be, as it were, revolutionized with life and activity, and a general prosperity would be the result of this mighty auxiliary to trade and commerce throughout the land.”21 The railroad, when it came, would meet high expectations."}

Sand and earth ballast would then be spread over the hurdles and crossties and rails laid on the ballast."}

First on the list was a requirement that the “engine must eАectually consume its own smoke.”61 Black, sulfurous coal smoke blowing across their lands had oАended the rural gentry in particular. This requirement had already been written into law in the 1825 Railway Act of George IV. To comply, locomotives had been designed to burn coke, a much cleaner fuel than coal, and to route waste steam up the chimney to increase the draft and fan the Йre."}

At twenty-three, in 1777, young Murdoch traveled to Boulton & Watt’s Birmingham factory and presented himself to Boulton, probably with a recommendation from James Boswell in his pocket—Boswell had visited the factory the previous year.22 Legend has it that Murdoch, powerfully built and more than six feet tall, presented Boulton with a wooden hat that he had designed himself and turned out on a lathe.

In autumn 1779 the Йrm sent him to Cornwall to erect steam engines for pumping out the copper and tin mines there; Cornwall had little coal, making the old Newcomen engines prohibitively expensive to operate."}
{"text": "Watt had more grievous trouble. His beloved Йfteen-year-old daughter, Jessy, a late child of his second marriage, was mortally ill with consumption. When her condition worsened that spring, Watt called in Darwin. He “gave little hopes,” Watt told his friend Joseph Black, “but prescribed for the fever and other urgent symptoms.” Darwin proposed they try Beddoes’s gases. Beddoes attended Jessy daily for a week, but he too could oАer Watt little hope. He arranged for Jessy to breathe eАervescent carbon dioxide. Her seizures—Watt called them “hystericks”—and weakness prevented him from trying other gases or medicines."}
{"text": "With support from Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood’s invalid youngest son, Thomas, the Duchess ofDevonshire, and others, Beddoes opened his laboratory and clinic in Bristol Hotwells on 21 March 1799. It drew large numbers of patients, whom Beddoes treated at Йrst with conventional remedies rather than gases, to establish his competence as a physician. For a laboratory superintendent, he had hired twenty-year-old Humphry Davy, fresh from a chemistry apprenticeship in his native Cornwall. Together they began experimenting with nitrous oxide, experiments that would eventually involve James Watt and the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey, and would tarnish Beddoes’s reputation."}
{"text": "They manufactured the gas in the Watt generator by heating crystals of ammonium nitrate. The Йrst time Davy inhaled the gas experimentally, he erupted “shouting, leaping, running” around the laboratory, his actions becoming “various and violent,” with a “highly pleasurable thrilling in the chest and extremities.”41 He was intoxicated, but neither he nor Beddoes interpreted his reaction as mere intoxication. For them, it was indication as well of a new medical treatment of powerful eАect—perhaps something that might restore motion in the limbs ofparalytics or energize invalids such as Tom Wedgwood."}
{"text": "The French government agreed. In 1803 it granted the engineer a concession of a pine forest near Le Havre with the proviso that he use it to distill a daily production of Йve hundred pounds of pine tar. To that end, he built a tar manufactory, but a Йre partly destroyed it, and a storm unroofed his house. Called to Paris to assist in organizing the city for the coronation ofNapoleon as emperor, Philippe Lebon was stabbed to death by an unknown assailant in the Champs-Elysees on the night of 2 December 1804.60 As late as 1837, Paris remained lighted only with oil lamps."}
{"text": "The district gas factories that fed those mains washed the gas of its Soho stink with lime cream, a mixture of slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and water. Untreated coal gas is foul with hydrogen sulЙde, which smells like rotten eggs and is highly toxic. Ammonia is another contaminant, as is carbon monoxide, odorless but deadly. GasiЙed solids such as coal tar and soot can be scrubbed from coal gas by bubbling it through water. Lime cream removes the toxic gases. As it does so, it becomes increasingly contaminated and eventually turns blue, a state that earned it the nickname “blue billy.” A ferro-ferricyanide compound, blue billy releases cyanide gas, which makes it smell of bitter almond or marzipan. Carted through the streets for disposal, it created a serious nuisance. Gas water and tar dumped into sewers, streams, and rivers foully polluted them."}
{"text": "Rembrandt Peale fared better in Baltimore. He built his gasworks in a building behind his museum and washed his coal gas with both water and lime cream. He put some showmanship into his 13 June 1816 opening night, advertising widely and debuting gaslight in what he called a “magic ring” of one hundred burners. A control valve allowed him to turn the ring ofМame up and down, something impossible with candlelight and hardly possible with oil.65 Spectators crowded the museum throughout the exhibition."}
{"text": "Four days after the magic-ring debut, Baltimore acted on an ordinance permitting Rembrandt Peale and four Baltimore businessmen to form the Йrst commercial gaslight company in the United States, the Gas Light Company of Baltimore.66 Less than a year later, the GLCB lit its Йrst street light and, after that, its Йrst commercial building and private home."}
{"text": "Gas lighting expanded slowly in America, however. “By 1850,” writes historian Christopher Castaneda, “about 50 urban areas in the United States had a manufactured gasworks. Generally, gas lighting was available only in medium-sized or larger cities, and it was used for lighting streets, commercial establishments, and some residences. . . . Other than gas, whale oil and tallow candles continued to be the most popular fuels for lighting.”67\n\nTallow is the rendered fat of cattle. Whale oil comes from whales. Castaneda is wrong about whale oil; not only the world’s largest mammal rendered up its fats and oils for lighting in the Йrst half of the nineteenth century, or whales would have been extirpated. They very nearly were."}

{"text": "Nantucket Island is a terminal moraine of glacial sand and gravel left behind by the melting of the great ice sheet that covered the upper half of North America until about thirteen thousand years ago. The island’s poor soil (Thomas JeАerson would call it “a sand bar”1) and isolation make it almost totally dependent on supplies shipped from the mainland. That was why the island had early founded its economy on the sea."}
{"text": "The new Nantucketers learned whaling in stages.Drift whaling-harvesting dead or dying whales washed up on shore after storms—is a self-evident technology,requiring only the necessary tools to cut up so large an animal and a strong stomach against the stink.Inshore whaling—rowing out in open boats to attack coasting whales spotted from beach lookout towers—may have been a Wampanoag practice.It was common among the European settlers on Cape Cod,Martha's Vineyard,and the New England coast.The historian Alexander Starbuck reports that in 1690 the Nantucketers,\"finding that the people of Cape Cod had made greater proficiency in the art of whale-catching than themselves,\"hired an experienced Cape Cod sailor named Ichabod Paddock to teach them how to hunt whales.8\n\nEuropeans hunted whales for their lighting oils,not their meat.By the second decade of the eighteenth century,the Nantucketers had identified the sperm whale as the source of the highest-quality oil.They had advanced from shore whaling to whaling in ships within a few day's sail of shore,returning to shore towing a whale carcass each time they caught one to process it.9 But sperm whales are pelagic,living in the open sea,and to hunt them,the Nantucketers had to build larger ships and prepare for extended voyages.So long as they hunted in the North Atlantic,they could store unrendered strips of blubber in barrels on shipboard for processing when they returned home."}
{"text": "When they began hunting in hotter climates,however—the Cape Verde Islands off the west coast of Africa,the Caribbean,and the Brazil Banks—the heat spoiled the unrendered fat.It became necessary to render the blubber in transit,for which purpose they mounted on deck an iron and brick tryworks, set with two or more large cast-iron pots,its fires fed initially with wood and then with the oily cracklings left over from the rendering itself.With ships capable of carrying several thousand barrels of oil and with a tryworks on deck for rendering at sea,the Nantucket fleet was prepared to range throughout the world's oceans,wherever sperm whales congregated."}
{"text": "In 1774 Nantucket's whaling fleet consisted of 150 vessels with an average \"burden\"—carrying capacity—of 100 tons.The fleet returned about 26,000 barrels of spermaceti oil that year,the product of some 3,000 sperm whales. Another 210 ships from other US ports also hunted sperm whales in 1774, bringing the total number of ships to 360 and the total production to at least 45,000 barrels.10 Milky spermaceti,scooped from the sperm whale's head chamber (the\"case\")hardens into white wax when exposed to the air.Blubber renders an oil of lower quality and lower value—so-called train oil I—but spermaceti for illumination was the prize."}
{"text": "After 1775, with the coming of war, this industry of great brutality and rich harvest collapsed. Early that year, the British House of Commons voted punitively to prohibit the rebellious New England colonies from commercial Йshing “on the Banks of Newfoundland, or any other part of the North American coast.”11 The Quakers of Nantucket, through their English kin, managed to win exemption for whaling, an important reason why they remained neutral during the war. The British navy captured 134 of their ships and impressed 1,200 of their seamen anyway, as William Rotch had feared, and another 15 ships were lost to shipwreck. The islanders sustained themselves with local Йshing and subsistence farming. In the hard winter of 1780, with the harbor frozen and the peat swamps and Йelds deep in snow, many suАered cold and near starvation."}
{"text": "Rotch did so a few days later, upping the ante: in addition to his previous request for compensated resettlement, he wanted to move thirty American ships to England to establish the proposed Йshery. Impossible, Hawkesbury responded: England required English ships and English seamen as a reserve for the Royal Navy, a long-standing British national security policy. He proposed shaving Rotch’s £100 per family to £87."}
{"text": "Recovery continued into the nineteenth century. By 1807, Nantucket’s Мeet numbered forty-six whalers; New Bedford sailed another forty.31 Having rounded the Horn, American ships now worked a populous sperm whale conМuence oА the coast of Chile: the onshore grounds. But Britain wasn’t through with its former colony yet. Having reignited war with Napoleonic France in May 1803, and with a much smaller population than France, it needed manpower for its navy. It began acquiring men by boarding American ships and impressing sailors, some ten thousand in all between 1800 and 1815, whom it claimed were British deserters. In fact, only about a thousand had been.32\n\nPresident Thomas JeАerson had responded to these coercive recruitments by proposing an embargo on the exportation of American whaling products, which passed Congress on 21 December 1807. Whaling could continue—and, to some degree, did—but the domestic market for oil and other whale products was limited. The embargo was such a disaster that JeАerson asked Congress to modify it to a nonintercourse act, removing all countries except Britain and France from the embargo and banning those two nations’ ships from US waters. He signed the modiЙed act on 1 March 1809, three days before the end of his presidency."}
{"text": "The whaling era that opened after the War of 1812, from about 1817 to the mid-1850s, has come to be called whaling’s golden age. Its primary anchorage shifted from Nantucket Island to New Bedford, below Cape Cod at the mouth of the Acushnet River. A shoal at the entrance to Nantucket Harbor—the Nantucket Bar—impeded the passage of the golden age’s larger and more heavily loaded ships; the thousands of barrels of oil in their holds had to be laboriously oА-loaded into lighters and rowed over the bar into the harbor at burdensome additional cost."}
{"text": "Eventually a Nantucket businessman, Peter Ewer, met the challenge.37 Drawing on the experience of the Dutch moving ships over shallows into the Zuider Zee, Ewer designed and had built what he called “Camels”: double Мoating drydocks 135 feet long, which could be Мooded and positioned port and starboard alongside the whaler with chains slipped under the hull cradling the ship between them. Steam engines then pumped out the two drydocks, which Мoated them and their cradled ship high enough to clear the bar when a steam tug hauled them into harbor."}
{"text": "Conservative Nantucketers resisted Ewer’s invention when the Camels Йrst launched in early September 1842, especially when the improvised chains snapped one after another and damaged the copper sheathing of a ship being hauled, the Phebe. Ewer had already ordered stronger chains. On 21 September his Camels lifted the whale ship Constitution over the bar and out to sea. More dramatically, on 15 October they brought in a loaded whale ship."}
{"text": "The US whaling Мeet had reached its maximum extent in 1846, with 736 ships totaling more than 233,000 tons burden.2 Whale oils were a depleting asset, inherently limited by their limited source: far more gallons of camphene and burning Мuids than of whale oils were produced for lighting in the United States in the Йrst half of the nineteenth century. Castor, rape, and peanut oils, tallow and lard were widely used as well, as were wood and grain alcohol. But camphene, at 50 cents a gallon, was cheaper than whale oil at $1.30 to $2.50 a gallon, and cheaper even than lard oil at 90 cents a gallon."}
{"text": "The primary turpentine tree in America,the longleaf pine,Pinus palustris, grew in great abundance in the American South,including some 400,000 acres (625 square miles)of sandy pine forests in eastern North Carolina.4 Workers collected crude turpentine,the liquid resin of the longleaf pine,by\"boxing\": cutting a large,chevron-shaped drainage into a tree with a deep notch below it that collected the liquid,which was then scooped out and barreled.s The process was similar to maple-sugaring,although boxing was far more damaging to the tree.Nor is resin the same as sap:rather than carry nutrients,resin is exuded as a natural bandage when a tree is wounded,the plant version ofa scab."}
{"text": "First-season turpentine was called “virgin dip” and earned the largest proЙt. Less valuable second- and after-year turpentine was called “yellow dip.” A tree might survive seven seasons despite the progressive damage of boxing and chipping to its structure. Loggers then harvested the dead and damaged trees for their dense heartwood.8\n\nBy the 1850s, turpentine production was declining in America. A new competitor surged into the lamp oil market: coal oil, distilled from cannel coal (oil shale) or asphalt/bitumen, a heavy hydrocarbon found naturally in semisolid pools such as Pitch Lake on the Caribbean island of Trinidad and the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. (Tar and pitch are traditional terms for asphalt/bitumen, but are also used, confusingly, for tree exudates.) The world’s most extensive reserve of bitumen occurs in the Canadian province ofAlberta, where the mineral in the form of oil sands—sand mixed with asphalt/bitumen —covers some Йfty-Йve thousand square miles, an area larger than England."}
{"text": "Thereafter Gesner concentrated on developing a fuel for lighting. He used the pitch he had collected in Trinidad as feedstock, conducting some two thousand separate experiments. By 1846, he had successfully distilled coal oil, as it was commonly called, from this bitumen.11 He demonstrated it at public lectures he delivered that year on Prince Edward Island and subsequently in Halifax, Nova Scotia.12 Newspaper stories about his lectures caught the attention of none other than the tenth Earl of Dundonald, Thomas Cochrane, admiral of the British North American and West Indian Мeet, based in Halifax. The earl happened to be negotiating for the mineral rights to Trinidad’s Pitch Lake. He enlisted Gesner as a consultant, and in 1851 won full control of the lake’s pitch deposits by acquiring all the surrounding land.13 The relationship formalized when Gesner moved to Halifax in 1849."}
{"text": "In amatter of months,the Canadian physician developed a distinctive process for making illuminating gas from bitumen with coal oil as an intermediary. When he applied for a Nova Scotia patent on his process in June 1849,he used the patent to protect his products'brand names as well,calling them kerosene and kerosene gas(from keros,Greek for\"wax,\"and -ene to associate the new products with familiar camphene).14\n\nA complex series of lawsuits over the next four years barred Gesner from developing the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick bitumen mining claims he believed he controlled.He lost a patron and partner in 1851 when Dundonald, then seventy-six,completed his naval service in North America and returned to England to spend the rest of his life-he died in 1860—promoting ventures in Trinidad.In 1853 Gesner packed up his wife and five sons and moved to New York.He had already applied for US patents for his kerosene products.He soon found a promising new market for lighting gas on Long Island."}
{"text": "That year,with US partners,Gesner formed a new venture,the North American Kerosene and Gas-Light Company,with a manufactory in Brooklyn along Newtown Creek.But the lack of intercity piping limited gas sales,which led Gesner and his company to concentrate on producing lamp fuels for the extended East Coast market.The Kerosene Oil Company,as people called it, announced in its prospectus that it would produce“Mineral Naphtha, Hydraulic Concrete,Burning Fluids,Mineral Tar and Pitch,and Railway Grease”from“Asphalte Rock [i.e.,bitumen]...found in inexhaustible quantities in the Province of New Brunswick.\"15 It emphasized that kerosene was ideal for the production of burning fluids less expensive than those currently in use.Gesner's US patents were issued in June 1854.For feedstock his company would initially use cannel coal from New Brunswick."}
{"text": "With these exceptional credentials, the Yale chemist was an obvious choice to evaluate a potential new feedstock for kerosene production when two businessmen approached him with that project in autumn 1854. It was generally known that petroleum—rock oil, as it was commonly called, translating its Latin compound—could be reЙned into kerosene using much the same distilling process that Gesner and others used for solid bitumens. The two men judged that a domestic liquid source would allow them to produce kerosene less expensively for the large and expanding market for lamp fuel than mined sources did. They had acquired a farm in western Pennsylvania, one hundred miles north of Pittsburgh in Venango County, near the town of Titusville, where seeps of brown, greenish-tinged oil gave their name to a stream called Oil Creek."}
{"text": "The oil had been seeping since its Йrst notice by early Spanish and French explorers. In the 1760s, a Moravian missionary to the Seneca Indians, David Leisberger, described seeing several kinds of oil springs in the area. The Senecas, Leisberger noted, puriЙed the oil by boiling it and then “used [it] medicinally as an ointment for toothache, headache, swellings, rheumatism, and sprains. Sometimes it is taken internally. It is of a brown color, and can also be used in lamps. It burns well.”24 The steady seepage into Oil Creek argued for a substantial underground reservoir. To Йnd that reservoir and tap it would require investment. Silliman, the two men hoped, would certify the value of the petroleum to potential investors."}
{"text": "By then, Brewer had given up his medical practice to join his father and his father’s partners in operating the Titusville sawmill and selling the lumber. Settled in Pennsylvania, Brewer recalled, “for the Йrst time, [I] examined the oil spring, in the vicinity of one of our saw mills.” What he found contradicted Hubbard’s hasty dismissal of its prospects: “I became satisЙed there was oil in abundance.” He discussed with his partners how to exploit it. They decided to try to increase its Мow and hired a local man, Jacob D. Angier, to do the work. On 4 July 1853, the sawmill owners signed a lease with Angier, the Йrst oil lease known to have been executed in the United States."}
{"text": "Back in Titusville, Albert Crosby negotiated an agreement with Brewer and his sawmill partners, who owned the farm where the original oil spring was located. (Bissell had preauthorized Crosby to do so if he liked what he saw.) The young attorney proposed to organize a joint-stock company capitalized at $250,000 ($7 million today), dividing among the parties the shares to be sold to investors. With that capital, the enterprise, to be called the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company, would buy the hundred-acre Hibbard farm outright for $5,000. The company’s public oАering would include the oil rights to several thousand more acres that the sawmill partners owned in the area."}
{"text": "After his preliminary report to Bissell and Eveleth, Silliman continued analyzing the Oil Creek petroleum sample to establish its potential commercial value. By late December, he could write the partners more optimistically: “I am very much interested in this research, & think I can promise you that the result will meet your expectations of the value of this material for many useful purposes.”38 The two men were happy to hear it."}
{"text": "In the meantime, the company went through several more reorganizations as the New Haven investors contrived to cut the New York men out of the deal. In 1858 a new entity, the Seneca Oil Company of New Haven, Connecticut, swallowed up the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company.44 Banker James Townsend and his fellow New Haven investors took control, brought in a new associate, a local man named Edwin L. Drake, and elected him president. It was Drake, improbably, who would Йnd a way to release petroleum from its stone detention underground."}
{"text": "There were two ways to bore a salt well, just as there had been in probing for coal in earlier times: kicking down a well using a spring pole, the old hard way; or chiseling a borehole with a drill string supported by a derrick and lifted and dropped by a small steam engine."}
{"text": "The Smiths arrived in Titusville on 20 May 1859, without Uncle Billy’s wife. His daughter, Margaret, said her mother thought Titusville “seemed too much like ‘back woods’ and she was afraid something might happen to us.”55 The family soon moved from the local hotel into the engine house, next to the well site. Work on the well began immediately with construction of a new engine house and a wooden derrick twelve feet square at the bottom and about thirty feet high, nailed together on the ground and then lifted into place like a barn raising by a crowd of local volunteers in late May or early June. Many of them had never seen a derrick before. One wag told a farmer who asked about it that a New York man was erecting it as a monument to mark the location of the biblical Tower of Babel. Locals called the project “Drake’s Folly.” In June as well, Mrs. Smith summoned her courage and moved to Titusville with the rest of her six children. She was prescient; during their time in Titusville, the Smiths lost their youngest daughter, Lida, to diphtheria, shortly before her seventeenth birthday.56\n\nLacking any other way to locate oil underground—dowsing and consulting spiritualists would come later—Drake chose to drill in the middle of the narrow island formed by Oil Creek on one side and, on the other, the water-powered sawmill’s millrace (a channel to divert water to a mill wheel).57 In August 1858, while he was still trying to Йnd a well driller, he had hired a crew to dig for oil in that location. Their spades soon struck oil, but they struck water at the same time, Мooding the hole. Drake had decided then that it would be cheaper to bore.58 What remained of that trial was an eight-foot hole cribbed with logs. That was where Smith began work, intending to crib on down to bedrock and then to bore a hole."}
{"text": "Back in New Haven, the investors had given up on Drake’s Folly—all but James Townsend, the banker. “You all feel diАerent from what I do,” Drake appealed to the investors. “You all have your legitimate business which has not been interrupted by the operation, while I staked everything I had upon the project and now Йnd myself out of business and out of money.”62 By then, two of Drake’s friends had cosigned a $500 note for him at a Pennsylvania bank to see him through. That August 1859, even Townsend decided that the venture was a lost cause and moved to shut it down. He wrote Drake to that eАect and enclosed a money order for $500 to pay any Йnal bills. Fortunately, the mail was slow."}
{"text": "Petroleum was hard to sell because it was costly to transport by wagon and smelled terrible in its raw state.Refining it required moving it from Oil Creek to one of the many refineries,most of them small,that sprang up between Titusville and Pittsburgh.But swampy or frozen dirt trails slick with spilled oil played hellwith caravans of up to one hundred wagons loaded with thousands of gallons of barreled oil."}
{"text": "“Fresheting”became a desperate alternative:raising the creek level with a wave of water—a freshet—to float the oil in flatboats perilously down Oil Creek to the Allegheny River.Flatboats holding up to eight hundred barrels of oil lined the creek banks waiting.Word went upstream to the first of more than a dozen private mill dams ponding the water on the creek and its tributaries. Crews stationed at the dams opened them in succession.The swell of water from the first dam,farthest up the creek,ran down to the second dam and so on,one after another as the freshet advanced.When the Kingsland Dam opened,three miles below Titusville,enough water had been released to cause the creek to rise two feet or more."}
{"text": "Within a half hour ofits release,time for a small crowd to gather,it found an errant fame,caught fire,and exploded.Black smoke billowed up and oil fell to earth as burning rain.A sheet of fire swept across the surrounding ground and ignited two more wells,several open vats of oil,a barn,and a legion of oil barrels stored nearby.Nineteen people were killed;dozens more badly injured."}
{"text": "The well burned for three days before drillers succeeded in smothering it with dirt and manure. Once under control, it Мowed at an astonishing three thousand barrels a day.7 Other gushers followed, beginning with one in May that Мowed three hundred barrels a day for Йfteen months before abruptly running dry, earning, for the lumberman who had bought the farm site for $1,500, about $2.5 million, or $67.8 million today."}
{"text": "Camphene, the other component of burning Мuid, similarly increased in price, because of its blockaded scarcity, from 35 cents per gallon prior to the Civil War to $3.80 in 1864.15 Not for the last time, a petroleum product— kerosene—rode into the marketplace on a government subsidy—exclusion from a punitive tax—and crowded out other fuels. By 1870, camphene and alcohol had all but disappeared from the market, while petroleum-derived kerosene sales had reached 200 million gallons annually.16\n\nThe other lighting product competitive with kerosene was sperm oil. The whale Йshery, economically strong before the war, fell into decline across the war and after.17 A major cause of the decline was predation. Ironically, as the whalers hunted and killed whales, so also did rebel cruisers of the Confederate navy hunt down and destroy Yankee whaling ships."}
{"text": "Three months followed with only two prizes. The Sumter sailed well enough, but its screw propeller was Йxed to its hull, causing drag that slowed the ship when operating under sail alone. Nor could it carry enough coal for more than eight days of steaming. Its Йrst Мurry of captures had already given Semmes a fearsome reputation in the Yankee press, leading merchant ships to hide in port or avoid the Caribbean, where his ship’s limitations had conЙned him. “It is of no use to chase sails anymore in these waters,” he decided in December; “the Yankees have nearly all disappeared.”20\n\nHe took two Йnal prizes and then sailed northeast into the Atlantic. There, in deep water, he caught and burned his Йrst whaler, the Eben Dodge out ofNew Bedford, before a hurricane turned his makeshift warship leaky and crank.I21 Semmes was proud of the Sumter despite its inadequacies. “She cruised six months [and] captured seventeen ships,” he wrote in his war memoir of his 1861 patrols.22 Reluctantly, he abandoned the Sumter at Gibraltar to be sold."}
{"text": "Semmes took command of the Alabama in the Azores on 24 August 1862 and began prowling for Yankee whaling ships as soon as its weapons were Йtted and its decks recaulked. Sperm whales chased schools of anchovies and sardines in the Azores in spring and summer, up to the beginning of October. It was rich pickings, with pairs of whales herding the Йsh into swirling balls and then breaching up through them with their mouths open to feed."}
{"text": "The American whale Йshery never recovered. From a total of 722 ships in 1846, the Мeet declined to 124 by 1886.27 In September 1871, pursuing increasingly wary whales—bowheads—through the Bering Strait into the Chukchi Sea oА Alaska’s North Slope, thirty-three of some forty whale ships, twenty-two from New Bedford, were trapped in pack ice and had to be abandoned. By then, kerosene derived from petroleum had replaced sperm oil as the fuel of choice for lighting, in America and across the world. Whaling survived, greatly diminished, by shifting its emphasis from oil to whalebone— for corset stays, umbrella ribs, and other uses that today are met with Мexible metal or plastic. Sperm oil continued to serve as a reЙned lubricant—it was the favored lubricant for machine guns during both world wars—until the 1960s, when Йrst jojoba oil and then synthetic ester lubricants replaced it."}
{"text": "The unexpected bounty of oil in the early years at Oil Creek accounted in part for the appalling waste in spillage, Йre, and freshet riding. A more indirect —but in the long run, more destructive—cause of waste and loss was the legal status of underground resources.28 By the law of that era, petroleum underground was analogous to underground water, was ferae naturae (“of a wild nature”), a wild animal of sorts and subject to the same rules of property. No one understood yet that water saturated porous rock underground; it was believed to Мow in underground streams much as surface streams and rivers do. The only way to Йx the location of underground water was to dig a well. Then the water that Йlled the well, having been located in a particular place, became the property of the person who owned the land on which the well was dug or the person to whom the owner had leased the rights.29\n\nAn early American case of this legal theory involved two men in dispute about who owned a fox: Mr. Post, the man pursuing it, or Mr. Pierson, the man who, knowing Mr. Post was on the chase, caught the fox and killed it anyway. (Neither man owned the land upon which he was hunting—a beach, in fact.) Mr. Post claimed possession of the fox by right of active pursuit and sued Mr."}
{"text": "Pierson for trespass. Mr. Pierson asserted in his defense that the fox, which Mr. Post had not yet brought under his control by wounding, catching, or killing, was not Mr. Post’s property; that it became Mr. Pierson’s property when he caught and killed it."}

In Franklin’s day, such applications had not been imagined yet. Electricity was something to be protected against and something to be explored. It was particularly valuable as an investigative tool for chemists.

{"text": "The Йrst major breakthrough toward harnessing electricity for power came in 1800, a decade after Franklin’s death. It followed from the confusing discoveries of an Italian surgeon and physiologist working at the Academy of Sciences in Bologna, Luigi Galvani, who was studying the eАects of electricity on the muscles of animals. No one knew what caused muscles to contract. Some speculated that the motive force was electrical, but it was diГcult to understand how electricity could operate in such a saline, conductive environment as a muscle. Galvani wondered if the nerves might carry the electric charge, with their greasy tissue somehow insulating it from its wet surroundings."}
{"text": "An assistant“gently touched the point of a scalpel to the medial crural nerves of this frog.”The signature\n\nbelow the schematic is Galvani's."}
{"text": "The frog's legs had contracted without any direct electrical connection to the Dollond.Of such unexpected and seemingly marginal events are scientific discoveries made.By his own account,Galvani failed to notice this unexpected response.He was distracted,he recalled,\"wrapped in thought ...and pondering something entirely different.\"The one who noticed the unusua event was his wife.As soon as Galvani understood what Lucia had seen,he grasped its radical provocation."}
{"text": "Across the next months and years,Luigi Galvani explored this discovery in detail,using both Dollond and Leyden jar discharges—\"artificial electricity,\"as it was called at that time—as well as Franklin's\"natural electricity\"of stormy skies.He published a full report of his work in Latin in 1791:Commentary on the Efects ofArtifcial Electricity on Muscular Motion(known in brief as the Commentarius)."}
{"text": "The Italian natural philosopher Alessandro Volta read the Commentarius in March 1792. A native of Como, on the southwestern end of the lake of the same name, Volta was professor of physics at the University of Pavia. He had already investigated static electricity and invented an improved way to generate it: a simple device called an electrophorus. During a two-year period when he was studying gases, he had discovered methane, Йrst collecting it from a swamp on the edge ofLake Maggiore. His discoveries and inventions made him known throughout Europe. The Royal Society of London elected him to membership in 1791."}
{"text": "Volta responded to Galvani’s 1792 report with enthusiasm and set to work repeating his countryman’s experiments.7 By April, he had begun to have doubts. Trying to reproduce one of Galvani’s experiments—connecting the back and leg of a living frog with a metal conductor—he had found that he needed two diﬀerent metals in contact with each other (“a key, a coin . . . but of an entirely diАerent metal from tin or lead”8) to make the frog’s leg contract. He pondered a variety of explanations, struggling with the accepted belief that animals generate a special kind of electric charge in their muscles and transmit it through their nerves. This “animal electricity” was believed to be diАerent from static electricity or lightning and unique to each animal. Galvani believed his experiments had elicited animal electricity rather than ordinary, non-vital electricity."}
{"text": "Volta doubted Galvani’s claim: If so, why did a living animal’s leg respond only when he linked spine to muscle with a bimetallic conductor? Why not a conductor made of only one metal as well? Volta suspected that the electric charge demonstrated by the frog’s response came not from the frog but from the contact between the two dissimilar metals—a conclusion that oАered an exception to the animal electricity theory and thus challenged its validity."}
{"text": "To conЙrm his suspicion, Volta tried another experiment. He prepared a frog leg with a long piece of nerve extending out of the thigh. To the bare nerve, but not touching the thigh, he then clipped two leads from a weakly charged Leyden jar. The leg muscles contracted. The current from the Leyden jar had stimulated the leg muscles even though it had circuited only through the nerve."}
{"text": "To Volta, that meant the current didn’t originate in the muscle, as the animal- electricity theory proposed."}
{"text": "Years intervened between Galvani’s 1792 report and Volta’s ultimate response, years of debate across scientiЙc Europe and of further experiments and reports. Napoleon invaded Italy in 1796 and demanded a loyalty oath of public oГcials, including Galvani. The physicist refused because the oath would have committed him to atheism, and he was a devout Christian. He lost his appointments and his income and died in poverty in 1798. Volta swore Napoleon’s oath and continued his research. In 1799 he invented the ultimate instrument of his rebuttal. He introduced it to the world in a letter to the Royal Society ofLondon on 20 March 1800."}
{"text": "Volta called his new instrument a pila: a pile. It stacked together disks of dissimilar metals—copper or silver, tin or zinc—separated by saltwater- saturated pieces of cardboard. With no animals involved, Volta’s pile generated electric charge. It did so continuously, not in isolated bursts."}
{"text": "Volta had invented what we now call a battery, an electrochemical generator of electric charge. For the Йrst time, a machine produced a continuous Мow of electric current. The elusive and invisible force had been brought under human control."}
{"text": "Across the next decade, the battery was improved. Volta’s pile tended to lose power as the saturated cardboard spacers dried out. So batteries were constructed of rosin-waterproofed wooden boxes containing a solution of electrolyte—dilute acid worked better than saltwater and soon replaced it— with metal plates slotted into the liquid. The more of these “cells,” the more powerful the battery. With a large battery, it became possible to heat Йne wires to incandescence and even melt diamonds. Humphry Davy used a battery of two thousand cells to demonstrate the intense blue-white brilliance of an electric arc at one of his public lectures in Britain’s Royal Institution in 1809."}
{"text": "An eyewitness to Davy’s demonstration described how “the spark, the light of which was so intense as to resemble that of the sun, struck through some lines of air, and produced a discharge through heated air of nearly three inches in length, and ofa dazzling splendor.”12\n\nCarbon-arc lighting, too bright and hot for household use, would become important in industrial, lighthouse, street, and retail lighting in the decades ahead. Curiously, neither Volta’s battery nor Davy’s arc light would stimulate further scientiЙc discovery for another twenty years—as if comprehending the novelty of current electricity took time."}

{"text": "The Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted's historic discovery of electromagnetism has long been attributed to a mere accident,as if Oersted had tripped over it as he might have tripped over a loose brick.All discoveries are partly accidental,by definition,but those who make them are seldom unprepared.Like almost every other natural philosopher in Europe,Oersted had responded to reports of Volta's pile by building one himself.He used it to experiment with the varying effects of acids and alkalis.He had learned the elements of chemistry in his father's pharmacy in a small Danish town on the island of Langeland,where he was born in 1777,about one hundred miles southwest of Copenhagen.By 1800,after attending the University of Copenhagen with his brother,Anders,he had earned his doctorate in physics and was lecturing at the university.The two brothers were talented.Anders, who studied law,would serve for two years in the 1850s as prime minister of Denmark."}
{"text": "“Men have always been inclined to compare magnetic forces with electrical forces.The great resemblance between the electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws must necessarily lead to this comparison.”But there was a problem with the comparison,Oersted continued:electricity seemed to act upon magnetic materials without responding to their magnetic fields,which had led other theorists to argue that electricity and magnetism were separate,independent forces.Experiment would have to resolve the issue,he concluded,but such intertwined forces would be difficult to sort out."}

{"text": "Oersted's historic experiment demonstrating an electric field deflecting a magnetic compass."}
{"text": "That discovery gave Oersted the law he was looking for,because the needle's positional reversal could mean only that the magnetic field which the electric current generated filled the space adjacent to the wire in circular form around it."}
{"text": "By positioning a compass above and below an electriЙed wire, Oersted discovered the circular form of the\n\nmagnetic Йeld surrounding the wire."}
{"text": "Besides electromagnetism itself and the presence of an extended magnetic Йeld around a current-carrying wire, one more fundamental discovery was necessary before engineers and inventors could begin to see how to apply current electricity to the electrical uses of the modern world. That discovery was the work of an extraordinary British chemist named Michael Faraday, a protégé ofHumphry Davy’s at the Royal Institution in London."}
{"text": "Faraday was born into poverty in London in 1791, his father a blacksmith in poor health. With only a few years of schooling, he began working at the age of thirteen as an errand boy for a bookseller and bookbinder, who apprenticed him the following year. “There were plenty of books there,” Faraday said later, “and I read them.” He also began studying the new science of electricity in the pages of the Encyclopædia Britannica and annotating a four-volume work of chemistry. In 1810 he joined a lecture society organized by a group of young London men interested in self-education. A literate new friend in that society committed two hours a week to helping Faraday improve his grammar and spelling, a program they continued together for seven years. Another friend, a banking clerk, sharing Faraday’s enthusiasm for chemistry, discussed new discoveries and solved chemical problems with him."}
{"text": "In 1831 Faraday Йrst heard of powerful electromagnets which two scientiЙc competitors, one of them an American researcher, Joseph Henry, had constructed by winding hundreds of turns of insulated wire around soft iron cores. When they ran a battery current through the wire winding, the iron core acted like a conventional magnet many times its size. Extrapolating from this experiment, Faraday acquired an iron ring like a large doughnut and wrapped two coils of wire separately around opposite halves. The leads from one coil he attached to a battery, the leads from the other coil he attached to an instrument for measuring electric current (a galvanometer, named in honor of Luigi Galvani)."}
{"text": "Once again the honor of discovery would go to the investigator who noticed and followed up a seemingly trivial side effect:Faraday noticed,paid attention, and ran a series of further experiments.\"In one setup,\"writes the science historian Michael Schiffer,\"he learned that the needle [of the galvanometer] would also deflect when the second coil was moved toward or away from the first.In addition,Faraday found that thrusting a permanent bar magnet into a hollow coil,or removing it quickly,briefly stirred an attached galvanometer.In further experiments with permanent magnets and coils,he obtained a consistent result:only when the magnet was moved briskly in relation to the coil did the galvanometer's needle move.\"21\n\nLike his competitors,Faraday was looking for a steady electric current from magnetism.He held back reporting his results.Instead,he borrowed the design of an experimental apparatus from a French researcher and used it to explore further.The instrument Faraday built consisted of a twelve-inch copper disk mounted on a brass axle between the two poles ofa horseshoe magnet powerful enough to lift thirty pounds.A wire attached to the brass axle,and a wire heading in a wire brush pressed against the copper disk,made a circuit with the galvanometer.When Faraday cranked the copper wheel through the magnetic field,the galvanometer registered a flow of induced electric current that continued so long as the disk was cranked."}
{"text": "Above the falls,where Lake Erie narrows into the Niagara River,early settlers built waterwheel systems along the riverbank or on small loop canals.These supported the common constructions of pioneer settlements:a sawmill and blacksmith's shop,a grist mill,a rope walk,a tannery,the first houses.A settler cleared an island in the river.Stocked with goats,it acquired the name Goat Island.By the 1830s,the river supported a line of modest industries built along its banks:a nail factory,a paper mill,a flour mill,another sawmill,and a woolen factory.Two hotels,the Eagle and the Cataract House,offered one hundred rooms between them for visitors and residents.4\n\nIn 1841 two American engineers calculated the energy available from the falls for turning waterwheels at 4.5 million horsepower.The US Army Corps of Engineers,surveying the Great Lakes in 1868,estimated Niagara's total available energy as about 6 million horsepower.But cutting a millrace through the eighty-foot thickness of Niagara's hard limestone shelf would be costly,and tunneling below the limestone through the soft shale would require lining the tunnel with multiple courses of expensive hard brick.Niagara was twenty miles from Buffalo,the nearest city,with no technology at hand to deliver power that far away.Nor did a population of workers live near the remote falls.Until the last decade of the nineteenth century,Niagara Falls was a powerful natural engine not yet in gear."}
{"text": "Revolutionary though steam was, the prime mover of the industrial revolution, it had signiЙcant disadvantages. Since its output was mechanical motion, it was inherently local. No one had found a way to deliver it at a distance except by cable, as with San Francisco’s and Pittsburgh’s cable cars, or pressurized air. It was inconvenient, requiring up to two hours to raise a working head of steam and a stoker’s regular attendance to maintain—hardly an arrangement that craftsmen or small businesses could aАord in time or money. Its smoke was foul, and because steam was local, its foul smoke polluted cities."}
{"text": "But if electricity had only begun to enter commercial service,Professor Adams told his London audience,such discoveries may still“pass through a stage of quiet development in the laboratory.\"8 Laboratories in the mid- nineteenth century systematically investigated the properties of electromagnetism.That research paralleled the development of the electric generator and its reverse,the electric motor.Spin the device with mechanical power from a steam engine or a waterwheel,and it output electric current. Input electric current into the device,and it output mechanical power,turning machines such as looms or the wheels of electric trolleys."}
{"text": "The kind of electric current mattered.Batteries produce a continuous fow of charge:direct current(DC).Generators—coils rotating past the opposing poles of a magnet—produce a regularly reversing fow of charge:alternating current (AC)."}
{"text": "Since batteries were the only source of current electricity until late in the nineteenth century,almost all the commercial developments of the era worked with the low-voltage direct current that batteries produce,much as mobile phones and laptops do today.Following that line,Thomas Edison pursued direct-current generation to supply electricity for the electric lighting system he was devising.Lacking experience with alternating current,engineers were skeptical of AC systems.\"They cannot make it safe,\"one of them claimed in a public lecture as late as 1888,after AC had become available commercially. \"They cannot make it reliable....They cannot make its lamps even [i.e., glowing steadily,not fickering].They cannot make its lamps last.They cannot make it sell by meter [i.e.,meter it].They cannot make it run by motors.\"9 But they could,and they did."}

To extend the range of his service, he developed a three-wire system, which made it possible to deliver direct current at reasonable cost to an area around a generating station about three times as large as his previous two-wire system had allowed.14 But long- distance transmission still escaped him. The problem wasn’t one of design but one of basic physics."}
{"text": "Stanley tried to explain to Pope that connecting his transformer in parallel, like connecting a motor in parallel, automatically adjusted the current. “I waxed eloquent over the automatic regulation of the system of parallel connection,” he recalled, “and tried my best to picture the phenomena clearly to him. But Pope’s conviction came slowly—more slowly than my patience could stand.”31 Stanley’s insight was that his parallel-connected transformer could be used to step up the voltage from an alternator while stepping down the amperage. The higher voltage and lower amperage would eliminate the need for thick, heavy wires and make it practical to transmit electricity eГciently across long distances. At the other end of the transmission line, the same process in reverse could step down the voltage to local requirements while boosting the amperage to useful power levels again."}

{"text": "This I did, and spent the following Saturday there. I found he had a complete system, barring, of course, the meter and the motor, that it was actually performing, and performing well, and, with relatively slight modiЙcation, could be put upon the market.39\n\nFrom Great Barrington, Byllesby traveled to Pittsburgh to brief Westinghouse. Byllesby was “enthusiastic to the last degree,” he says, but the Pittsburgh industrialist and his associates still hesitated.40 A tour of the Berkshire installation on 6 April 1886 Йnally sold them on Stanley’s system. “This visit,” Stanley recalled, “determined Mr. Westinghouse to actively enter the alternating-current Йeld, as the novelty and scope of the system surprised him greatly.”41 Commercialization followed. By winter, a full-scale power station was delivering alternating current throughout BuАalo, and by summer 1888, no fewer than a hundred Westinghouse central stations powered electric lights in cities and towns across the eastern United States."}
{"text": "A crucial turning point came in 1890. A power system had been planned in the late 1880s that would avoid intruding into the area of the Niagara Reservation. That area included the shoreline of the Niagara River from the American Falls back past Goat Island about a mile to Port Day, as well as the river below the falls to the Suspension Bridge, a railroad bridge two and a half miles downriver. The plan involved digging a tunnel two and a half miles long and fourteen feet in diameter from the riverbank east ofPort Day underground by the shortest line of descent past the falls to the lower river, where it would discharge below the Suspension Bridge. Connected to this raceway by more than three miles of cross tunnels, 238 wheel pits would hold that number of 500-horsepower waterwheels to power 238 mills. A new industrial community could then establish itself outside the Reservation to process and manufacture goods by waterpower."}
{"text": "The plan might have worked, given enough investment. But tunneling through more than Йve miles of hard limestone would be expensive, and developing an industrial city with hundreds of mills in what was still a semi- wilderness would have been, in the words of the Йrst historian of the Niagara development, Edward Dean Adams, “visionary, requiring a generation in time and fortunes in expenditures to create.”52 The plan pointed backward to older technologies at a time when new technologies were almost at hand for generating electricity and transmitting it to distant cities, BuАalo Йrst ofall."}
{"text": "The power plant in its Йnished conЙguration was a marvel. McKim, Mead & White, the architectural Йrm that designed the Brooklyn Museum and the National Museum of American History, in Washington, DC, designed the transformer house, using limestone quarried in Queenston, Ontario, and laid up by Italian stonemasons. The generator and transformer houses were built at ground level upriver from the falls, above Niagara City. Water diverted into a channel from the river entered the powerhouse and dropped 140 feet down an array of ten vertical pipes called penstocks. The curved lower end of each penstock directed the rushing water horizontally through a large double- wheeled turbine. After spinning the turbines, the water Мowed into a common tunnel that led to the main discharge tunnel, a brick-lined, shield-shaped conduit 17 feet wide by 21 feet high. That behemoth carried the discharge water 6,700 feet downstream to a partly submerged outlet into the Niagara River below the falls."}
{"text": "The turbines connected back up to the 5,000-horsepower generators aligned on the Мoor of the powerhouse above, turning the generators and generating electricity. The electricity was then transferred to a transformer house, stepped up to 11,000 volts, and sent on its way to BuАalo."}

As electrical power became available to reduce aluminum from its ore, the light, lustrous metal became more common and less expensive."}
{"text": "Setting omnibuses on rails increased the number of passengers that horses could haul and improved the ride.In 1856,when New York City's Common Council judged street-level steam locomotives to be dangerous and barred them below Forty-Second Street,horse-drawn street railways replaced them.Rails set fush with the pavement superseded the raised rails that had damaged private carriages and irked other drivers.4Line owners commissioned larger,lighter cars to increase ridership:accommodating more passengers per trip meant they could reduce fares.One such railway delivered more than three and a half million rides between Upper and Lower Manhattan in 1859.5 Boston saw similar numbers despite its narrow,crowded streets.In every nineteenth- century American city,the absence of traffic controls made the confusion worse.6 Traffic police and mechanical signals would be twentieth-century innovations."}
{"text": "Midwestern farmers bred the horses the city required—haphazardly at first, but with increasing expertise at selective improvement as the century advanced. By far the most popular workhorse in the United States was the Percheron,a breed that originated in the Perche region of France,about ffty miles southwest of Paris.Although it was long claimed that the Percheron breed was shaped in the Middle Ages when native Perche mares were bred with Arabian stallions brought back from the Crusades,no evidence other than oral tradition supports the claim.Some archeological evidence identifies the type as having Neolithic antecedents.8 All modern Percheron bloodlines trace to a warhorse named Jean Le Blanc,foaled in Le Perche in 1823 when Perche breeders were breeding a heavier horse for the American trade."}

As the engine turned over,fuel—gasoline or alcohol,or a mixture of the two一 in a timed sequence sprayed into its cylinders,where it was compressed and then spark-ignited,causing it to burn,heating and expanding so that it pushed on a piston connected to a rod that,again,transferred the motion outside the engine to turn a pair of wheels."}
{"text": "The electric car was simpler:a box of batteries,an electric motor,and a sliding lever or pedal to control the motor's speed.Its problem,besides frequent and slow recharging,just as today,was its relatively low power:since batteries were heavy,higher power had to be traded for battery life.The electric was ideal for city driving,however,clean and quiet,the mechanical equivalent ofa horse and buggy.But with little charging infrastructure outside the city,it was unsuited for pleasure driving or longer-distance travel."}
{"text": "Steam engines and electric motors could be run up smoothly from idle to full power without gearing. But to operate without stalling, internal combustion engines had to idle at a rate of at least 900 revolutions per minute, and, for maximum eГciency, at 2,000 rpm or more, which meant they required gearing to reduce the number of rotations delivered to their wheels.13 With their gears as well as with their more complicated engines, they were more demanding (and expensive) to build and operate than the other systems. Nor was it easy to learn to coordinate a clutch and gearshift on what came to be called a standard transmission. At Йrst, Maxim writes, “when someone rasped the gears, it was considered evidence that my design was faulty.” Later, when enough people had mastered steering, clutching, and shifting gears at the same time, “anyone who forgot to push down the clutch and rasped his gears was in disgrace and considered not competent to drive.”14\n\nEach type of vehicle power system had its champions and its detractors. Why internal combustion prevailed is a subject that historians of technology have long debated. Most arguments relate to infrastructure: the necessary systems that surround a technology and support it. Electric cars were limited largely to city driving because the countryside, not yet electriЙed, lacked recharging stations. Steam and internal combustion engines could usually Йnd fuel in the local paint or general store, partly because gasoline was used as a cleaning agent and solvent, partly because farmers had taken up stationary gasoline engines to operate everything from washing machines to grain mills."}
{"text": "For at least one steam carmaker, the Stanley Motor Carriage Company of Newton, Massachusetts, that advantage was lost in 1914, when an epidemic of deadly hoof-and-mouth disease among New England farm animals led veterinary oГcials to shut down the many public watering troughs along eastern roads where steamers had rewatered.15 Massachusetts had already challenged steamers for the clouds of steam they discharged, which obscured the vision of the drivers behind them, especially in cold weather. To solve that problem, Stanley developed a recondenser for its engines, but sales collapsed in the meantime. The damage was done."}
{"text": "By 1914, the internal combustion engine had swept the Йeld. The Stanley and other steamer companies built a total of only about 1,000 of their cars that year, compared with a total of 569,000 by conventional US automobile manufacturers.16 There were 1.7 million registered motor vehicles in the United States by 1914, up from 8,000 in 1900. Automobiles outnumbered horses in New York City for the Йrst time in 1912, and the diАerence widened across the decade.17 By the 1920s, horses were disappearing into pet food at the rate of a half million a year.18 Except for local delivery service, the horse was departing the city, never to return."}
{"text": "The substitution of the automobile for the horse left farmers poorer. “By using the power produced by gasoline instead of by corn- and hay-burning horses,” a rural economist wrote in 1938, “we have deprived the farmer of a market for the crops from many million acres.”19 As unintended consequences, farmers lost a major source of income, while the world lost a renewable resource, replaced by a fossil resource of unknown extent and unanticipated eАect."}
{"text": "Even without its punitive tax,alcohol cost more to produce than gasoline, particularly since it lacked a supply chain from farm to refinery nearly as efficient as the pipelines and railroad cars of the Rockefeller-monopolized petroleum industry.(By 1882,the Standard Oil Trust controlled 85 percent of the world oil market,one reason the US Supreme Court in 1911 ordered it broken up.22)As with wood compared with coal in Elizabethan London,the cost of delivery disadvantaged alcohol compared with gasoline.Alcohol would have required government support to develop as a full alternative.But it had immediate and valuable advantages as an additive."}
{"text": "A higher-compression engine could power a larger car. It would give better mileage, saving fuel. Or it could be smaller, saving weight. But higher compression—squeezing the mixture of fuel and air injected into the cylinder into a smaller volume, so that it pushed harder and longer on the piston when it burned—caused white gas to break down, burn at the wrong time in the engine cycle, and waste power. What sounded from the driver’s seat like a ping or a knock was, inside the cylinder, an aberrant and damaging explosion."}
{"text": "Engine knock became a serious problem around 1913, when the increasing demand for gasoline led oil reЙners to maintain volume by distilling more crude into the product, lowering its octane further.23 Engineers believed that engine knock was the result of premature ignition of the fuel—that compression alone was the problem. No one knew for sure, because it was diГcult to know what was going on inside the cylinders ofan operating engine Йring at thousands of revolutions per minute. If the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine was to serve as the predominant power source for the automobile, its fuel and engine-design problems needed to be addressed."}
{"text": "In 1916 the problem of engine knock engaged the attention of a highly creative engineer named Charles F. Kettering, who would later become vice president for research at General Motors. Born in 1876 on a farm in northern Ohio to a family ofAlsatian and Scotch-Irish descent, Kettering was tall, strong, and smart but beset with eye problems that almost kept him from attending college. He made it through with the help of classmates who read to him when his eyes failed. He was twenty-seven years old by the time he graduated from Ohio State University with a degree in electrical engineering."}
{"text": "Kettering was a good experimenter and an excellent inventor. For National Cash Register, he developed the Йrst electric cash register, powered by a small, high-torque electric motor. For Cadillac, in 1911, piggybacking on his cash register experience, he invented the electric starter—another high-torque electric motor—which opened the automobile market for the Йrst time to the many women who found it diГcult to start a car with a hand crank."}
{"text": "Kettering and Midgely worked on the problem ofengine knock for six years. Once they understood what caused it,they realized that the primary solution was not in redesigning the engine but in raising the octane of the fuel.The obvious way to improve automobile fuel was to mix alcohol,with its high octane rating,with gasoline.Alcohol and gasoline don't mix unless the alcohol is free of water,but they mix freely with the addition of a third ingredient, benzene,a hydrocarbon distilled from coal.A30 percent or 40 percent mix of alcohol with gasoline and a little benzene made engines purr.Kettering and Midgely called that solution to their problem the \"high-percentage additive.\"27 They found it by 1918,patented it,but then set it aside.28 It would function as a backup,a reserve,in case they found nothing better.Excellent additive though it was,alcohol had its own problems."}

In 1959 the US Public Health Service supported an Ethyl Corporation request to increase the lead content of gasoline from 3 cc to 4 cc per gallon—because reЙners had reached a limit in improving fuel through reЙning and were now losing yield to keep up octane.70 The Public Health Service did so despite a complaint by the committee of physicians it appointed to study the matter that “since the 1925 investigation, there have been no follow-up studies of large population groups on how adding TEL to gasoline aАects the total body burden of lead.”71\n\nBy 1963, more than 98 percent of US gasoline was leaded. When, a decade later, lead was Йnally ordered removed from the US gasoline supply, it was removed because it fouled the new catalytic converters mandated to Йght smog, a diАerent air pollution problem, not because it had been labeled a dangerous pollutant itself. Long before then, however, despite the extension of American oil supplies with a toxic additive, the United States had fulЙlled British chemist Harold Hibbert’s prediction that it would be “under the necessity ofpaying out vast sums yearly in order to obtain supplies of crude oil from Mexico, Russia, and Persia.”72 Persia—Iran—certainly, and Mexico as well, but most of all Saudi Arabia, a formerly sleepy kingdom of camels and sand."}

Davy was demonstrating a new source of light, not welding. Welding was still something blacksmiths did by hammering together pieces of metal heated in a forge. An electric arc was more than hot enough at 6,500°F (3,600° C) for welding, but industrial electric welding pulled more current than batteries could sustain and awaited the development of the generator."}

One historian speaks of “the chronic inability ofAmerican shipbuilders to compete with foreign shipyards.”35 Most of the vessels other than proprietary passenger ships built between 1910 and 1914 were railroad-car and dump barges.36 Steel ships were still riveted together, not welded, with the single known exception of one Great Lakes forty-foot icebreaker and workboat, the Dorothea M. Geary, built in Ashtabula, Ohio, and launched on Lake Erie in 1915.37\n\nConditions changed with the coming of the Great War.

More than 100 Americans died among a total of 1, 198 passengers killed in the German sinking of the British liner Lusitania in May 1915.

{"text": "Natural gas had advantages over town gas:it had double the energy content; it burned cleaner;and since it was drilled rather than manufactured,it was far cheaper—in 1930,about three times less expensive per million Btus,II meaning it promised greater profits to suppliers.Its disadvantages included the cost of pipelines necessary to move it from gas fields to customers (typically urban residential users)and uncertainty about the volume of reserves in gas fields—the problem that had forced Pittsburgh to abandon natural gas for a return to coal.50 Adjusting tens of thousands of home appliances to handle natural gas's higher heat content required a large investment in service workers.Gas companies recouped some of their investment by training their service workers to sell homemakers additional appliances."}
{"text": "Despite this expansion, huge volumes ofgas went to waste. Wet gas—gas that Мowed mixed with petroleum—was routinely vented into the atmosphere or Мared oА. Gas was often left to vent into the air, sometimes for years, when drillers abandoned dry holes. A 1935 US Federal Trade Commission report to Congress estimated that 20 percent more gas was wasted nationwide between 1919 and 1930 than was consumed: 4,375 billion cubic feet wasted compared with 3,520 bcf consumed.52 A lack of pipelines to deliver the gas to markets accounted for part of the waste, but “Texas oil drillers,” historian Christopher Castaneda concludes, “concerned only about ‘black gold,’ continued to vent trillions of cubic feet of ‘waste gas’ into the atmosphere.”53 Though the question of global warming had not yet emerged to public perception, natural gas—methane—is about thirty times more eАective than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. No one has calculated how much the vast waste of natural gas across the decades of the twentieth century—in the United States and throughout the world—contributed to global warming. The percentage was certainly more than zero."}

Even during the period of official American neutrality,from September 1939 until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941,US petroleum shipments supported the allied defense."}
{"text": "Pipelines to carry petroleum had been made larger and longer since the Йrst two- and three-inch lines moved Pennsylvania Oil Creek crude from wellheads to the railroad in 1863. By the beginning of the twentieth century, pipe size had been standardized at eight inches because larger pipes tended to split at the seams. But an eight-inch line could deliver only about twenty thousand barrels a day, while by 1930, a major reЙnery could process up to 125,000 barrels a day. The initial solution to this bottleneck was “looping”: laying down a second pipeline alongside the Йrst.61 In the 1930s, advances in steel technology allowed manufacturers to draw seamless steel pipes larger than twelve inches in diameter, which the oil industry called “big-inch” pipes. Lowered demand during the Depression didn’t justify much construction, however. Only about ten thousand miles of pipelines were laid in the United States during that decade.62\n\nTo foil the German submarine menace, a consortium of eleven private oil companies called War Emergency Pipelines incorporated on 25 June 1942 to build a government pipeline to carry petroleum from East Texas to reЙneries in the Northeast. Construction began the next day.63 The Big Inch pipeline would be twenty-four inches in diameter and 1,254 miles long, with pumping stations every 50 miles, capable of moving up to 335,000 barrels of crude daily, the largest and longest pipeline ever built up to that time."}

The energy in a reactor comes from U235, which neutrons of any energy can Йssion.

And since uranium Йssion was at least a million times as energetic as coal burning, ten thousand tons of uranium —seemingly the entire US supply known to the scientists as of 1944—would be equivalent to ten billion tons of coal, meaning, at most, ten years of coal- equivalent atomic energy."}

{"text": "After Йve years of sea duty, Rickover qualiЙed for further education. He used the opportunity to earn a master’s degree in electrical engineering at the Naval Postgraduate School and to study at Columbia University, after which he looked around and decided that the navy’s submarine service oАered the fastest route to advancement. It turned out not to be. An intense workaholic with a Chicago accent and a nasal, high-pitched voice, Rickover didn’t look or act like a standard-issue naval oГcer, nor did his Jewish heritage improve his prospects in what was then an anti-Semitic branch of service. (Years later, choosing oГcers for his enlarging Мeet of nuclear submarines, he deliberately picked tall, rugged, Nordic-looking men as potential commanders, provided that they were smart and ambitious as well.11) He forged ahead anyway, serving for three years as engineering oГcer on an outdated submarine, the USS S-48, learning enough to redesign and rebuild its cantankerous electric propulsion motors."}
{"text": "Rickover was one ofЙve naval oГcers assigned to Oak Ridge in 1946 to learn about atomic energy and nuclear power. Since he outranked the other four, he took command and directed their study and collective research. Navy scientists had investigated nuclear propulsion for ships during the war, but the technology had not yet won serious commitment. With the Manhattan Project itself an army operation, the navy brass worried more about army domination of the new atomic weapons than about nuclear energy for power."}
{"text": "Rickover, after studying the subject, concluded that the ultimate naval Йghting platform would be a nuclear-powered submarine, its boiler a nuclear reactor that required no oxygen, capable of sailing underwater for weeks on end, quiet and immensely lethal. As atomic weapons had Йnally given the US Air Force the bombs it needed to fulЙll its fantasy ofwinning wars from the air, so would atomic torpedoes—and, more to the point, nuclear missiles, when those came along—give the navy the ultimate power ofnuclear deterrence."}
{"text": "The navy didn’t know that yet, but Rickover did. Across the next three years, against immense resistance, he applied what he called his “orthodontic approach”—the quiet, unrelenting pressure that moves teeth—to the challenge of moving the navy to commit to building nuclear submarines. “To many in high places, however,” writes a later member of Rickover’s team, “the proposal sounded like a trip to the Moon.”13 A key strategy was arranging his dual appointment to the Atomic Energy Commission as well as to the navy, which allowed him to Йght resistant bureaucrats from two corners at once. “If the Navy doesn’t like what we’re doing,” Rockwell quotes him as saying, “we’ll do it with our AEC hat.”14 He needed AEC authority anyway, since the commission alone was authorized to sign contracts involving atomic materials and atomic secrets."}

All Йssionable materials became the property of the US government, as beached whales once became the property of kings. No one might build or operate a reactor except under government license, nor might such devices be owned privately. Authority over atomic energy was vested in a commission of civilians, the Atomic Energy Commission, responsible to the president—“the most totalitarian governmental commission in the history of the country,” one historian has called it.15\n\nProponents of the bill that became the Atomic Energy Act had argued that atomic energy was too important to be left to the military. Apparently, it was also too important to be conveyed to the people. Few outside the Manhattan Project and even fewer in Congress knew much about atomic energy. Almost everyone believed that atomic bombs were original inventions rather than straightforward applications of nuclear physics and explosives engineering. Keep the “secrets” of their design, then, and the United States could maintain a monopoly for years, perhaps for decades, to come."}

Polluted Pittsburgh had begun urban redevelopment in the late 1940s, instituting strict smoke control. By the time the AEC solicited bids from private industry for the Shippingport project, sulfur-oxide controls were also pending in the Pittsburgh area. Duquesne had been petitioning to build a coal-Йred power plant on the Allegheny River, but area residents were resisting. “We encountered a great deal of harassment and delay from objectors,” Fleger said. “It began to look as if we wouldn’t be able to complete the plant in time to meet the power demands we were facing.” The AEC’s PWR project was a godsend: no expensive precipitators for smoke control, no expensive scrubbers for sulfur-oxide control, 60 megawatts ofpeak-load power, and a leg up on nuclear-power technology."}

Work progressed smoothly. “We are able to do our work with few letters and no fuss,” Rickover told Congress. “There has never been a single letter written between the Commission and the Duquesne Light Company since the contract was signed with them. It has never been necessary.”\n\nA hands-on director, Rickover would arrive at the site from Washington in the evening or late on a Friday afternoon, to keep his managers worrying nights and weekends. “There was a motto down here,” Duquesne president Stanley SchaАer remembered, “that some of us who were the doers learned to hate: the admiral’s motto, ‘Full Power in Fifty-Seven.’ ” Not everyone loved the admiral, but he got the job done."}

The uranium-oxide fuel in its Йrst use had to be fabricated and clad with zirconium. Rickover’s group had stimulated the creation of a new industry to bring that exotic metal’s production up to the new nuclear industry’s demands. A by-product of zirconium production was the excellent neutron absorber hafnium, element 72, which would serve for the Shippingport reactor’s control rods."}
{"text": "Rickover sounded testy toward the end, early in 1957, when the congressional committee overseeing the project came out to Pittsburgh to take a look. “I think we have babied a lot of people in this country too long with the glamour of atomic energy,” he told the congressmen, “and I think as soon as possible, we have got to get down to do it like any other business.” Someone made the mistake of asking him about the new, larger power reactors then being designed.

Bravo was the Йrst test of a new “dry” hydrogen bomb, Shrimp, fueled with solid lithium deuteride rather than the cryogenically cooled liquid deuterium used in the Йrst test of a thermonuclear device, Mike I, on 1 November 1952. The dry bomb was much lighter and would therefore be an easier lift for US bombers. (Mike, an experiment rather than a weapon, weighed 82 tons; Shrimp, only 10.5 tons.) The lithium deuteride in the Shrimp device would make its own hydrogen by transmuting its lithium to a hydrogen isotope, tritium, an instant after detonation."}
{"text": "But as one of the Castle physicists,Harold Agnew,told me later,the Shrimp designers had not realized that one of the two isotopes of lithium in the fuel, lithium 7,would be reactive.They had believed that the Liz,representing 60 percent of Bravo's lithium content,would essentially be inert under the conditions of the experiment.It actually reacted as energetically as the 40 percent content of Li6,tripling the device's expected yield,from a projected 5 megatons to 15 megatons—that is,from 5 to 15 million tons of TNT equivalent.Bravo exploded into a 4.5-mile-diameter fireball,vaporized a crater 250 feet deep and more than a mile wide on the ocean floor,and spread dangerous fallout across more than 7,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean. Besides exposing Pacific islanders,who had to be evacuated,twenty-three crew members of the Japanese fishing vessel Lucky Dragon,which was operating outside the designated test exclusion zone,were contaminated with fallout and experienced acute radiation sickness.One crew member eventually died.There was an international outcry as the radiation cloud,lofted into the jet stream,fell out around the world."}

{"text": "Such a seeming reversal of the AEC’s position came about because the agency admitted geneticists onto its committees, resulting in a debate between physicians and geneticists—between health concerns for present populations, that is, and genetic concerns for future populations—which the geneticists eventually won."}
{"text": "A key Йgure in this debate was a geneticist named Hermann Muller, a small dynamo of a man, Йve feet two inches tall, born in Manhattan in 1890 and another denizen of the Мy room as a Columbia undergraduate and graduate student. In 1926, now a professor of zoology at the University of Texas in Austin, Muller reported discovering artiЙcial mutation—demonstrating for the Йrst time that irradiating Drosophila with X-rays increased its mutation rate. That discovery, giving researchers an artiЙcial method of inducing mutation, made it possible to shape experiments to study the genetic basis of life. Muller received the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery."}
{"text": "Edward Calabrese, the University of Massachusetts professor of toxicology who recently unearthed Hermann Muller’s eАorts to suppress opposition to his research Йn dings, has charged that the LNT model and its acceptance were the result, in his words, of “untruths, artful dodges, and blind faith.”41 Jan Beyea, a physicist and public health consultant, has argued to the contrary that many other studies and committees across the past Йfty years have found in favor of an LNT standard, which remains in place. As a Canadian scientist writes, “It was the leading physicists responsible for inventing nuclear weapons who instilled a fear of small doses in the general population. In their highly ethical endeavor to stop preparations for atomic war, they were soon joined by many scientists from other Йelds. Eventually, this developed politically into opposition against atomic power stations and all things nuclear.”42\n\nThe LNT debate was crucial to the long-term decline of nuclear power in the United States. Celebrated at Йrst as a clean and potentially inexhaustible new form of energy, nuclear power lost popular support in large part because of a general public fear of radiation. That fear was exacerbated by the Damoclean sword of nuclear war that hung over the world in the long years of the Cold War, as well as by the three accidents that have occurred at nuclear power plants since the introduction of commercial nuclear power: Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima Daiichi. The AEC and its successors, as well as the nuclear-power industry, have attempted to assuage public fears by asserting minimal or no damage from low-level radiation—even sometimes arguing for a positive, hormetic eАect. An antinuclear movement that originated in hostility to population growth in a supposedly Malthusian world promoted in turn the LNT model, exaggerating its eАects."}
{"text": "One of Jan Beyea’s conclusions seems relevant to this ongoing, contentious, and destructive debate. “What is often lost in disputes over radiation dose response models,” he writes, “is that risks at the low dose levels that are being debated are also low.”43 Low doses of radiation are not only low risk; they’re also lost in the noise of other sources of environmental insult."}

{"text": "By Shushkevich’s reckoning, the Chernobyl accident was a failure of governance, not of technology. Had the Soviet Union’s nuclear-power plants not been dual-use, designed for producing military plutonium as well as civilian power and therefore secret, problems with one reactor might have been shared with managers at other reactor stations, leading to safety improvements such as those introduced into US reactors after the accident at Three Mile Island and into Japanese reactors after Fukushima."}
{"text": "Antinuclear activists, whose agendas originated in a misinformed neo- Malthusian foreboding of overpopulation (and a willingness at the margin to condemn millions of their fellow human beings to death from disease and starvation), may fairly be accused of disingenuousness in their successive arguments against the safest, least polluting, least warming, and most reliable energy source humanity has yet devised. Having moved successively through poorly supported arguments about safety and radiation, by the second decade of the twenty-Йrst century they were reduced to two challenges: that nuclear power cost too much and that no safe method had yet been devised to dispose of nuclear waste."}

Every energy system has its advantages and disadvantages, as this excursion through four hundred years of energy developments should have made clear. And given the scale of global warming and human development, we will need them all if we are to Йnish the centuries-long process of decarbonizing our energy supply—wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, natural gas. As a harbinger of what’s coming, the Iranian city of Bandar Mahshar suАered a heat index—a measure of temperature and humidity combined—of 165°F (74° C) in August 2015.

{"text": "Why should adoption of a new energy source be so slow?Marchetti's important answer is that society is a learning system.It works by cultural diffusion—the spreading of ideas from one person to another—much like a disease epidemic.Inventing a new technology is only the beginning.Henry Ford's Model Ts needed filling stations.Filling stations needed gasoline,gasoline came from oil,oil had to be discovered,refineries had to processit,pipelines had to deliver the oil to the refineries and the gasoline to the cities where the cars were driven.People had to give up riding horses or horse-drawn buggies and buy cars,learn how to drive—and so on.When zippers began replacing buttons,there were those who resisted the change because they believed zippers were sinful:they made it easier to disrobe."}

{"text": "3.Record—A collection of data items(fields)of various types,which may also be records themselves.If EMPl is a record in the master file of employees,EMP1.NAME may be a character field,EMP1.ZIP an integer field,and EMP1.SAL a real field."}
{"text": "4.File —Collection of records that normally consist of matching types of fields.Records in a file may be accessed sequentially(the entire file must be read until the needed record is reached)or randomly(the record contains a key field,which determines its physical loca- tion in storage)."}
{"text": "7.Object—An object is a specific member of a class."}
{"text": "2.Input —Transfer data from external devices,such as a keyboard or disk file,to the program."}
{"text": "3.Output—Transfer data from the program to an external device,such as a printed,screen,or a disk file."}
{"text": "1.Conditional statements —Change the sequence in which instructions are executed depending upon the logical relationship(s)between variables and/or between variable(s)and set value(s)."}
{"text": "2.Iterative statements —Force the repetition of instruc- tions depending on preset conditions."}
{"text": "3.Calling statements—Transfer control to a subprogram unit."}
{"text": "2.Subroutine or procedure subprograms—Return values through parameters or global variables (see scope)."}
{"text": "2.Portability —A program should adhere as closely as possible to a standard version of a language and avoid highly machine-dependent constants and constructions. Unidentified machine-dependent information should be localized and identified for simplification of transport."}
{"text": "3.Indentation,when possible,clarifies conditional and iterative constructions,and spacing improves the general readability of a program."}
{"text": "4.The use of subprogram units allows separation of the various operations of a program into modules,thereby clearly delineating the program logic.Specific types of calculations,input,and output may be done in distinct modules;in many cases,the main unit will consist primarily of calling statements to a few modules."}
{"text": "The proper handling of certain common errors can improve the run-time behavior of programs.In most cases, awareness of inherent problems in machine handling of data and attention to program details can avoid program crashes due to error.The following should be considered when the program code is being designed:\n\n1.Input validation statements should be used to automati- cally check input data,to produce a clear message when an error is found,and to allow reentry of erroneous data. Data input should be echoed for user verification and an opportunity allowed for alteration of specific data items."}
{"text": "2.A method of exiting the program in case of a run-time error,which produces a message to the user as to the type and location of the error,should be provided.The possibility of certain errors occurring can be anticipated, and the use of flags and conditional constructions may provide a path to exit the program gracefully."}
{"text": "3.It is necessary to avoid predicting the exact value of a real variable,because after several operations,it may have been rounded off one or more times."}
{"text": "4.Side effects in subprogram units are unintentional changes in data values defined in other units.These fre- quently occur when the scope of a variable is mistakenly considered because of insufficient cross-checking to be local,when it is,in fact,global."}
{"text": "1.9.8 FORTRAN Language\n\nFORTRAN names (e.g.,unit,variable,array)consist of an initial letter (see defaults for real and integer types in the following)followed by letters or digits,the maximum length of which is 6 characters."}
{"text": "With little extra effort,code can be written so as to mini- mize the difficulty areader will encounter in comprehending the program logic.Several considerations in improving readability of a program are\n\n1.Names should be as descriptive as possible(e.g., DEPTH rather than 12)."}
{"text": "2.Comments should be liberally used to describe the data and logic of the program;they should be brief when placed in the body of a program unit,but may be longer and more descriptive at the beginning of a program unit."}
{"text": "1.9.8.1 Data Types\n\nSee the section\"Statements\"for forms of declaration of type."}
{"text": "Integer —Variable names starting with I-N,unless otherwise declared."}
{"text": "Real—Variable names starting with A-H and O-Z, unless otherwise declared."}
{"text": "Double precision—Must be declared."}
{"text": "Character —Must be declared with length of string; default length is 1."}
{"text": "1.9.8.2 Data Structures\n\nVariable —May be assigned value by a numerical or character constant,by input,or by an expression."}
{"text": "Array— May have up to seven dimensions;number and size(upper and lower boundaries)of dimensions are declared in DIMENSION or TYPE statements."}
{"text": "File —External(physical)only;may be sequential or random access."}
{"text": "WRITE(device#,label)varl,var2,..."}
{"text": "NUMBER returns number of connected device NAMED returns.TRUE.or .FALSE."}
{"text": "2.Linkers and loaders — Linkers resolve references between program units and allow access to system libraries;loaders place code into the main memory locations from which it will be executed."}
{"text": "4.Utility programs—Simplify use by performing partic- ular tasks for the programmer,such as editing,debug- ging,etc."}
{"text": "5.File manager systems—Maintain files and handle data input to and output from the files.Database management\n\nsystems (DBMS)contain integrated sets of files related by their use and provide uniform software interfaces for accessing data.The essential relationships between records in the files may be of several types,including sequential,associative,or hierarchical."}
{"text": "6.Telecommunications monitors—Supervise commu- nications between remote terminals and the central computer."}
{"text": "1.9.10 System Hardware\n\nSystem hardware consists of the central processor,the input devices(usually a keyboard),the output devices(probably both a video display terminal and a hardcopy printer), long-term storage devices,and perhaps communications components.In smaller systems,more than one of these components may be \"built in\"to one unit,while in larger systems there may be many units each of several compo- nents associated with the system."}
{"text": "Keyboards are the most widely used input devices, but optical scanners and digital pads (for computer-aided design)are some additional input devices.Input may also be from files stored on a disk or tape."}
{"text": "Video display terminals for output are available in several sizes(measured diagonally in inches)and various resolutions.Laser printers are common forms of hardcopy output devices.Color and even photo-quality laser printers are readily available.For engineering and design use,plot- ters,either black-white or multicolored are frequently added to the system.Output may also be sent to a disk or CD for long-term storage."}
{"text": "Long-term memory storage devices include floppy disks, zip disks,and CDs.The choice between storage devices is based on the amount of available storage needed.Floppy disks can store up to 1.44 MB of data,and CDs can store up to 700 MB of data."}
{"text": "Systems may also include modems,which connect com- puters to other computers or servers.Computers may be connected to other computers over telephone lines,through cables,or using satellite transmission or other wireless methods.Modem speed is usually measured in bps or bits per second.Telephone modems usually have a rate of 56 Kbps."}

{"text": "Time.Physical events generally occur in some causal sequence.Time is a measure of this sequence and is required in addition to position in space in order to fully specify an event."}
{"text": "Mass.A measure of the resistance of a body to changes in its state of motion."}
{"text": "Body.A collection of particles.A rigid body is a rigidly connected collection of particles."}
{"text": "Force.The action of one body on another.This action will cause a change in the motion of the first body unless counteracted by an additional force or forces.A force may be produced either by actual contact or remotely(grav- itation,electrostatics,magnetism,etc.).Force is a vector quantity."}
{"text": "Couple.If two forces of equal magnitude,opposite direction,and different lines of action act on a body, they produce a tendency for rotation,but no tendency for translation.Such a pair of forces is called a couple. The magnitude of the moment produced by a couple is calculated by multiplying the magnitude of one of the two forces times the perpendicular distance between them. Moment is a vector quantity,and its sense of direction is considered to be outwardly perpendicular to the plane of counterclockwise rotation of the couple.The moment of a single force about some point A is the magnitude of the force times the perpendicular distance between A and the line of action of the force."}
{"text": "Velocity.A measure of the instantaneous rate of change of position in space with respect to time.Velocity is a vector quantity."}
{"text": "Acceleration.A measure of the instantaneous rate of change in velocity with respect to time.Acceleration is a vector quantity."}
{"text": "2.1.1.3 General Laws\n\nThe foregoing defined quantities interact according to the following fundamental laws,which are based upon empiri- cal evidence."}
{"text": "Conservation of mass.The mass of a system of particles remains unchanged during the course of ordinary physical events."}
{"text": "Principle oftransmissibility.A force acting at a point on abody can be replaced by a second force acting at adifferent point on the body without changing the state of equilibrium or motion of the body as long as the second force has the same magnitude and line of action as the first."}
{"text": "2.1.1.3.1 Newton's Laws of Motion\n\n1.A particle at rest will remain at rest,and a particle in motion will remain in motion along a straight line with no acceleration unless acted upon by an unbalanced system of forces."}
{"text": "2.1.1.4 Systems of Units\n\nTwo systems of units are in common usage in mechanics. The first,the SI system,is an absolute system based on the fundamental quantities of space,time,and mass.All other quantities,including force,are derived.In the SI system the basic unit of mass is the kilogram (kg),the basic unit of length(space)is the meter(m),and the basic unit of time is the second(s).The derived unit of force is the Newton(N),which is defined as the force required to accelerate a mass of 1kg at a rate of 1m/s² ."}
{"text": "The U.S.customary or English system of units is a gravitational system based upon the quantities of space, time,and force(weight).All other quantities including mass are derived.The basic unit of length(space)is the foot (ft), the basic unit of time is the second (s),and the basic unit of force is the pound (lb).The derived unit of mass is the slug,which is the unit of mass that will be accelerated by a force of one pound at a rate of 1 ft/s².To apply the slug in practice,as in Equation 2.1.2,the weight in pounds mass must first be divided by g=32.2 fts²,thus generating a working mass in units of lb-s²/ft,or slugs."}
{"text": "Whenever the weight of a body is significant in compar- ison to the external forces,the weight,or body force,must be considered in both the force and moment balances."}
{"text": "One of the simplest structures is the truss.A truss consists of straight members connected at their end points only(two force members).All loads,including the weight of the members themselves,are considered to be supported at the joints.Due to its construction and the assumption of loading at joints only,the members of a truss support only loads of axial tension or axial compression.A rigid truss or a rigid structure will not collapse and can only deform if its members deform.A simple truss is one that can be con- structed,starting with three members arranged in a triangle, by adding new members in pairs,first connecting one end of each together to form a new joint,and then connecting the other ends at separate existing joints of the truss."}
{"text": "A frame is a structure with at least one member that supports more than two forces.Members of a frame may support lateral as well as axial forces.Connections in a frame need not be located at the ends of the members. Frames,like trusses,are designed to support loads,and are usually motionless.A machine also has multiforce members.It is designed to modify and transmit forces and, though it may sometimes be stationary,it always includes parts that move during some phase of operation."}

{"text": "2.1.3 Dynamics\n\nDynamics is the study of the mechanics of rigid bodies in motion.Itis usually subdivided into kinematics,the study of the motion of bodies without reference to the forces causing that motion or to the mass of bodies,and kinetics,the study of the relationship between the forces acting on a body,the mass and geometry of the body,and the resulting motion of the body."}
{"text": "in space but is located on the particle and moves as the particle moves.There is no position vector and the velocity and acceleration vectors are written in terms of unit vectors 个，tangent to the path of motion,and j,inwardly perpendic- ular to the path of motion."}
{"text": "The velocity is always tangent to the path of motion, and thus the velocity vector has only one component (Equation 2.1.20)."}
{"text": "When dealing with the motions of rigid bodies or systems of rigid bodies,it is sometimes quite difficult to directly write out the equations of motion of the point in question as was done in Examples 2.1.4 and 2.1.5.It is sometimes more practical to analyze such a problem by relative motion.That is,first find the motion with respect to a nonaccelerating reference frame of some point on the body,typically the center of mass or axis or rotation,and vectorally add to this the motion of the point in question with respect to the reference point."}
{"text": "between the forces acting on a body or system of bodies and the resulting motion."}
{"text": "body.The net change in momentum is zero.This is called the principle of conservation of momentum."}
{"text": "Note that e is defined in terms of the components of the velocities,not the vector velocities,whereas the momen- tum balance is defined in terms of the vector velocities To solve Equations 2.1.32 and 2.1.33 when all the veloc- ities are not colinear,one writes the momentum balances along the principal axes and solves the resulting equations simultaneously\n\nFor purely elastic impacts,e=1,and for purely plastic impacts,e=0.For elastoplastic impacts,e lies between zero and one and is a function of both the material properties and the velocity of impact."}

{"text": "2.2 FLUID MECHANICS\n\nIn fluid mechanics,the principles of conservation of mass, conservation of momentum,the first and second laws of thermodynamics,and empirically developed correlations are used to predict the behavior of gases and liquids at rest or in motion.The field is generally divided into hydrostatics and hydrodynamics and further subdivided on the basis of compressibility.Liquids can usually be considered as incompressible,while gases are usually assumed to be compressible."}
{"text": "2.2.1.1 Fluid Dynamics\n\nWhen fluids are in motion,the pressure losses may be determined through the principle of conservation of energy For slightly compressible fluids,this leads to Bernoulli's equation(Equation 2.2.9),which accounts for static and dynamic pressure losses (due to changes in velocity),but does not account for frictional pressure losses,energy losses due to heat transfer,or work done in an engine."}
{"text": "For Newtonian fuids the dynamic viscosity is constant (Equation 2.2.13),for power-law fluids the dynamic viscos- ity varies with shear rate(Equation 2.2.14),and for Bingham plastic fluids flow occurs only after some minimum shear stress,called the yield stress,is imposed(Equation 2.2.15)."}
{"text": "where ε is the surface roughness.Equation 2.2.17 can be solved iteratively.If the Reynolds number falls between 2,000 and 4,000,the flow is said to be in the critical zone, and it may be either laminar or turbulent."}
{"text": "Components of a piping system that are connected in series produce additive pressure drops,while components that are connected in parallel must produce the same pres- sure drop."}
{"text": "While the modified energy equation provides for calcu- lation of the flow rates and pressure drops in piping systems, the impulse-momentum equation is required in order to calculate the reaction forces on curved pipe sections.The impulse-momentum equation relates the force acting on the solid boundary to the change in fluid momentum.Because force and momentum are both vector quantities,it is most convenient to write the equations in terms of the scalar components in the three orthogonal directions."}
{"text": "Equations 2.2.21 and 2.2.22 apply only as long as the fluid velocity at the throat of the choke is subsonic.Sonic velocity is the speed of a pressure wave in a fluid.Once sonic velocity is achieved,the effects of the downstream pressure can no longer be transmitted to the upstream side of the choke."}

{"text": "2.3 STRENGTH OF MATERIALS\n\nThe principles of strength of materials are applied to the design of structures to assure that the elements of the structures will operate reliably under a known set of loads. The field encompasses both the calculation of the strength and deformation of members and the measurement of the mechanical properties of engineering materials."}
{"text": "In the region where the relationship between stress and strain is nonlinear,the material is said to be plastic. Elastic deformation is recoverable upon removal of the load, whereas plastic deformation is permanent.The stress at which the transition occurs,oy,is called the yield strength or yield point of the material,and the maximum stress is called the ultimate tensile strength,UTS,of the material. Standard engineering practice is to define the yield point as 0.2%permanent strain."}
{"text": "In the region where the relationship between stress and strain is linear,the material is said to be elastic,and the constant of proportionality is E,Young's modulus,or the elastic modulus."}
{"text": "σ=Eε (2.3.3)\n\nEquation 2.3.3 is called Hooke's law."}
{"text": "γ=△α (2.3.5)\n\nFor an elastic material the shear stress is related to the shear strain through a constant of proportionality G,called the shear modulus.The shear strain is dimensionless,and the shear modulus has units of force per unit area."}
{"text": "In practice,loads are not necessarily uniformly dis- tributed nor uniaxial,and cross-sectional areas are often variable.It becomes necessary to define the stress at a point as the limiting value of the load per unit area as the area approaches zero.Furthermore,there may be tensile or compressive stresses(ox,0y,oz)in each of three orthogonal directions and as many as six shear stresses(Txy,Tyx,Txz, Tzx,Tyz,Tzy).The direction of the shear stress is indicated by two subscripts,the first of which indicates the direction normal to the plane in which the load is applied,and the second of which indicates the direction of the load.Note that for static equilibrium to exist,Txy =Tyx,Txz=Tzx, and Tyz=Tzy."}
{"text": "If a multidimensional state of stress exists,the effect of Poisson's ratio causes the tensile and compressive strains to be dependent on each of the components of stress."}

{"text": "Thermodynamic Variables.Thermodynamic variables are quantities found from experimentation to be necessary or convenient to specify to give a macroscopic descrip- tion of a system.Most such quantities are drawn from other branches of science or engineering;accordingly,no detailed,all-inclusive definitions of thermodynamic vari- ables can be given."}
{"text": "State of a System.When all of the variables necessary to describe a system are specified,the state of the system is said to be specified.The specification of the state of a system gives no information on the process by which the system was brought to this state."}
{"text": "Processes and Cycles.When one or more properties of a system change,the system is said to have undergone a change in state.The path of the succession of states through which the system passes is called the process. When a system in a given initial state goes through a number of different changes of state or processes and finally returns to its initial state,the system has undergone a cycle."}
{"text": "Equilibrium.A fundamental concept in thermodynam- ics is that of equilibrium.The key idea is that the vari- ables describing a system in equilibrium do not change with time.This idea does not form a sufficient basis for\n\na definition of equilibrium,because it fails to exclude a number of steady-state processes (principally various types of flow processes)that cannot be handled by classic thermodynamic methods.To exclude these,a more restric- tive definition is used:A system is in equilibrium if and only if it is in a state from which no change is possible without net changes in the surroundings.In steady-state processes,there must be continual changes in the surround- ings to maintain the variables of the system at constant values.Classic thermodynamics deals only with systems in equilibrium."}
{"text": "Equilibrium is an abstraction,and real systems are never strictly in equilibrium,but so long as the variables do not change measurably during the time spent making a measurement on the system,the system can be considered to be in equilibrium,and thermodynamic reasoning can be applied to it.A system may be in equilibrium with respect to some variables but not with respect to others."}
{"text": "This statement of the third law defines only entropy dif ferences at absolute zero,not absolute values.Just as the absolute value of energy is undefined and only energy dif- ferences can be measured,so can only entropy differences be measured.However,if entropy values for all reversibly connected states are equal at absolute zero,this entropy value may as well be taken to be zero for convenience."}
{"text": "Heat transfer is a transit phenomenon and can be thought of as energy transfer across the boundary per unit time.In the SI system of units,heat transfer is measured in watts (W),which is the number of joules per unit time crossing the boundary.In the English engineering system of units, heat transfer is usually measured in British thermal units per hour or Btu/hr."}

{"text": "For any reversible process,the sum of the changes in entropy for the system and its surroundings is zero.All nat- ural or real processes are irreversible and are accompanied by a net increase in entropy."}
{"text": "Several useful statements have been formulated con- cerning the second law that are helpful in analyzing thermo- dynamic systems,such as:\n\n● No thermodynamic cycle can be more efficient than a reversible cycle operating between the same temperature limits."}
{"text": "● The efficiency of all reversible cycles absorbing heat from a single-constant higher temperature and rejecting heat at a single-constant lower temperature must be the\n\nsame."}

{"text": "Studies of surface geological features and interpreta- tions of past processes,coupled with surface geophysical investigation techniques such as seismic,gravity,magnetic, radioactive,electrical,and geochemical methods,are used to locate probable subsurface target regions that may con- tain economically valuable accumulations of hydrocarbons. However,only by drilling from the surface to these subsur- face regions is it possible to definitely assess whether hydro- carbons exist and to determine quantitatively their distribu- tion and composition.Drilling from the surface—whether on land or from floating platforms—allows drill holes to test subsurface rocks and provides a direct sampling of rocks and fluids from subsurface regions.These subsurface fluids,if present,can be assessed for their economic value."}
{"text": "2.5.1 General Rock Types\n\nThe Earth is composed of three general rock types:igneous, sedimentary,and metamorphic.Reference 1 provides a general background of these three rock types and their relationships in the rock cycle,sometimes called the rock recycle."}
{"text": "Igneous rocks represent the solidified products of mag- matism and volcanism—processes that bring molten mate- rials close to the Earth's surface,allowing these materials to erupt on the surface(volcanic rocks)or freeze at shallow levels within (intrusive or plutonic rocks)the Earth.Such rocks comprise variable yet definable mineral assemblages, usually constituting relatively dense,compact,and weakly porous materials.Fracturing in igneous rocks may provide substantial permeability;however,because igneous rocks generally are not found in sedimentary basins that otherwise would preserve hydrocarbon accumulations,this rock type seldom hosts significant hydrocarbon concentrations."}
{"text": "Sedimentary rocks comprise materials derived from the weathering and erosion of preexisting rocks and soils. These materials have been variably consolidated and cemented(clastic sedimentary rocks)or precipitated directly from water(chemical sedimentary rocks).Partic- ulate materials and dissolved rock components are trans- ported by water,wind,and ice(as glaciers)to new locations, where they eventually assemble by means of the general process of lithification into a new rock mass.The eroded material from which sedimentary rocks are derived,called protolith,may be igneous,sedimentary,or metamorphic or some combination of these forms.During the process of weathering and erosion,especially by water,geochemical components of the original rock mass may be dissolved and may therefore be transported separately from the original rock fragments.This is an important characteristic of the genesis of sedimentary rocks because such dissolved com- ponents may reprecipitate—re-form from solution—and constitute the cementing agent in sedimentary rocks.These pore-illing cements are very important in determining the hydrocarbon storage capacity of sedimentary rock units and require assessment for any rock considered a potential hydrocarbon source."}
{"text": "2.5.2 Historical Geology\n\nBased on studies of radioactive isotopes derived from mete- orites,the age of the Earth is estimated to be approximately 4,650 million years;the oldest known rocks,found in metamorphic rock assemblages in northern Canada and in Australia,are approximately 3,800 million years old [2].Radiometric age dating,first devised in the early part of the 20th century,provides geologists with a means of establishing the absolute ages of rock units containing radioactive minerals that were formed at the same time as the enclosing rock.However,in the search for petroleum and gas resources and because most hydrocarbons occur in sedimentary rocks,petroleum geologists rely on the relative geological ages of rock units to unravel the sedimentary and structural history of potential hydrocarbon-bearing rocks."}
{"text": "Geologists generally use two characteristics of geolog- ical processes to determine the relative ages of rock units, especially of sedimentary rock sequences."}
{"text": "1.The principle of uniformity states that the internal and external processes affecting the Earth today have been operating unchanged and at the same rates throughout the developmental history of Earth.This means that an historical geological event preserved in the rock record can be identified and compared to similar events occurring at the present time in terms of the elapsed time and the geological processes necessary for that event to have occurred.Therefore,rates of deposition,erosion, igneous emplacement,and structural development are preserved in the geological column and can be compared with current similar processes[2,3]."}
{"text": "Examples of the types of observations used to establish relative time are given in the following list:\n\n● Superposition is fundamental to the study of layered rocks.This means that in a normal layered sedimentary rock sequence,the oldest rocks were deposited first and are at the sedimentary base of the sequence.Younger rocks were deposited last and are at the top of the sequence."}
{"text": "● Succession offora and fauna refers to the deposition of sedimentary material that includes the remains of contemporaneous plant and animal life.Fossils of these plants and animals may be preserved in the rock for- mations that result from the processes of deposition and lithification.The presence,absence,or change of the plant and animal life within a sequence of the geological column,as indicated by the presence,abundance,and diversity of fossil evidence,provides important informa- tion that allows geologists to correlate rock formations and thereby relative time from area to area.The fos- sil records within sedimentary sequences also provide important information regarding the evolution of life through geological time."}
{"text": "● Cross-cutting relationships are essential for the determi- nation of the relative ages of rocks that show rock- to-rock contact.The idea is that any rock(especially igneous rocks)or structure(such as a fault or sedimen- tary bedding feature)that transects or \"cuts\"another must be younger than that feature.The feature that has been transected must have been present (older)before the cross-cutting feature(younger)existed."}
{"text": "Because trapping of organic materials with resultant prevention of organic material oxidation is essential to the generation of economically important hydrocarbon accumulations,rapid burial of organic-bearing sediments is geologically favorable;as such,sedimentary basins in which sediment input is high and basins in which reducing conditions are maintained over extended periods, along with input of elevated amounts of marine organic materials,are considered most prospective for hydrocarbon- source rocks.For this reason,geologists and geophysi- cists are employed to interpret the sedimentation and tectonic history and the lithologic settings of rock vol- umes that are considered favorable for petroleum and gas occurrence [3-6]."}
{"text": "2.5.3.1 Source Rocks\n\nSource regions for hydrocarbons(shale)are required to have a substantial input of organic material and,to pre- serve that material so that it may mature in to liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons,a geochemically reducing environ- ment.Restricted sedimentary basins accumulating detrital continental debris and marine organic matter represent the most favorable environments for the storage and generation of hydrocarbons."}
{"text": "2.5.3.2 Migration\n\nOrganic matter buried in reducing environments(usually of marine nature)may accumulate in sufficient quantities to be considered geochemically and economically important source rocks.Because of thermal and load stresses applied to such sediments and the organic materials they host,this organic matter may change chemically and may be driven from the source rock along more permeable and porous pathways.These chemically and thermally changed hydro- carbons may,if structural and thermal conditions permit (see sections on \"Structural Geology\"and \"Traps\"),cease migration,accumulating in rock masses called reservoir rock."}
{"text": "After hydrocarbons accumulate in a rock mass serving as a reservoir,the hydrocarbons must be preserved from oxidation,from escape along other structural avenues,and from bacterial activity that might convert the hydrocarbons to sulfur,as in sulfur deposits of west Texas,the Gulf Coast region of the southern United States,the Misraq area of eastern Iraq,and southern Poland.Because the Earth is dynamic,the stability of any reservoir rock is transitory, and rocks that otherwise appear to be excellent storage media may no longer host hydrocarbons because of changes in local or regional structural,tectonic,or sedimentary regimes.Recently however,the mystery of accumulation of hydrocarbons has expanded since petroleum geologists and engineers have learned how to commercially produce hydrocarbons from shale reservoirs which hitherto have been considered too tight a pore space to provide commer- cial accumulations."}
{"text": "2.5.4 Structural Geology\n\nThe law of original horizontality states that all sediments are deposited essentially horizontally in response to gravity and the approximate Stoke's law of settling of particles. Sedimentary rocks,originally deposited as horizontal or near-horizontal sediment beds,undergo diagenetic changes that result in variable lithification.Because of the dynamic nature of Earth forces,sedimentary rocks are subject to myriad stresses and changes in stress regimes.Rock masses respond to such stress and stress changes by deforming, with deformation taking place on scales varying from microscopic to hundreds of kilometers."}
{"text": "These structural features of deformed sedimentary rock sequences comprise some of the most important reservoirs for hydrocarbons and water and are therefore of significant interest to petroleum geologists and geophysicists in the search for petroleum resources [3]."}
{"text": "● Strike—a line on the horizontal surface represented by the intersection of the fault plane and the hori- zontal surface.The strike line is always horizontal, and since it has direction,it is measured either by azimuth or bearing.Strike is always perpendicular to the dip."}

{"text": "porosity;although these are different characteristics of hydrocarbon-host rocks,they are each significant in deter- mining whether a rock unit may serve or might have served as a source or storage media for hydrocarbons."}
{"text": "2.5.6 Basic Engineering Properties of Rock\n\nBecause sedimentary rocks constitute the most important source and storage rocks for hydrocarbons and water, petroleum engineers emphasize the significance of under- standing the nature of sedimentary rocks and the deposi- tional environments that formed them."}
{"text": "From an engineering point of view,porosity is classi- fied as:\n\n● Absolute porosity—total porosity of a rock,regardless of whether the individual voids are connected."}
{"text": "● Effective porosity—only that porosity due to voids that are interconnected."}
{"text": "It is the effective porosity that is of interest.All further discussion of porosity will pertain to effective porosity."}
{"text": "2.Secondary porosity—voids formed after the sediment was deposited.The magnitude,shape,size,and intercon- nection of the voids bears little or no relation to the form of the original sedimentary particles.Secondary porosity is subdivided into three classes."}
{"text": "● Solution porosity refers to voids formed by the solution of the more soluble portions of the rock in the presence of subsurface migrating(or surface percolating)waters containing carbonic and other organic acids.Solution porosity is also called vugu- lar porosity where individual holes are called vugs."}
{"text": "● Fractures,fissures,and joints represent planar sur- faces formed in response to applied stresses that produce local rock failure.These structures may be of tensional or compressional nature,and they may individually contribute nominal to volumetrically substantial permeability to a rock mass by locally enhancing the connection between pores or between porous rock units."}
{"text": "● Dolomitization is the process by which limestones, dominated by the mineral calcite,are transformed into a Ca-Mg carbonate,dolomite [Ca,Mg(CO₃)2]. This process involves a significant change in rock density;because dolomite has a greater density than limestone,rocks undergoing dolomitization develop voids.These voids may result in very substantial increase in rock porosity (and permeability),mak- ing some dolomites excellent hydrocarbon reservoirs (e.g.,the Ordovician-age Ellenberger dolomite of West Texas)."}
{"text": "The typical value of porosity for a clean,consolidated, and reasonably uniform sand is 20%.The carbonate rocks (limestone and dolomite)normally exhibit lower values (e.g.,6-8%).These are approximate values and do not fit all situations.The principal factors that complicate intergranu- lar porosity magnitudes are uniformity of grain size,degree of cementation,packing of the grains,and particle shape."}
{"text": "● Pore volume is 100%filled with flowing fluid;therefore, k is the absolute permeability."}
{"text": "·Viscosity of the flowing fluid is constant.In general,this is not true for most real fluids.However,the effect is negligible ifμat the average pressure is used."}
{"text": "● Isothermal conditions prevail."}
{"text": "● Flow is horizontal and linear\n\n● Flow is laminar."}
{"text": "In general,there is considerable variation in the geother- 1mal gradient throughout the United States and the world.In many regions of the world where there is evidence of rather thin crust,the relationship between temperature at depth and depth may not be approximated by the linear function given in Equation 2.5.9.The increase in temperature with depth has important consequences for drilling and produc- tion equipment that is used in the petroleum industry.The viscosity of drilling and production fluids will,in general decrease with high temperatures.The sitting time for well cement will generally decrease with increased temperature, as will the strength and fracture toughness of steels used in drilling,well completion,and production."}

{"text": "Mature basins:These basins have sedimentary deposits that are approximately 70 million years in age or greater and have no important deposition continuing today.Cementing of the deposited particles has taken place such that most of the overburden is supported by the rock structure in the formations.The basin region has experienced tectonic activity and future activity is possible.Any high abnormal subsurface pressures are due mainly to past tectonic activity. Examples of such basins are the shelf area of the Permian basin in West Texas,San Juan basin in New Mexico, Anadarko basin in Oklahoma,Piceance basin in Wyoming, Appalachian basin in Pennsylvania through West Virginia to Tennessee,Triassic basin in Algeria,and Ordos basin in China to mention a few."}
{"text": "The total pressure acting on a subsurface rock mass and the fluids it contains is a function of the weight of the rock (called lithostatic pressure)and fluid(called hydrostatic pressure)affecting the given subsurface rock mass.Because rocks are essentially\"squeezed\"by tectonic,lithostatic,and hydrostatic pressures,the fluids within rocks develop and exhibit a variable and generally substantial fluid pressure, referred to as pore pressure.Pore pressures represent the environmental equilibrium of a rock-fluid mass and change dramatically in response to local aberrations in applied pressure,such as the changes engendered when a surface drill hole penetrates a rock mass."}
{"text": "Fluids within rock pores may be inherited,such as sed- iments that contain original fluids from their depositional environments,called connate waters,or the fluids may be introduced,such as the gas-oil-water media that migrate into appropriate rock masses."}

{"text": "in pressures at depths approaching the maximum theoretical overburden pressures."}
{"text": "The fluid pressure in the rock at the bottom of a well is commonly defined as pore pressure(also called formation pressure,or reservoir pressure).Depending on the maturity of the sedimentary basin,the pore pressure will reflect geological column overburden that may include a portion of the rock particle weight (i.e.,immature basins),or a simple hydrostatic column of fluid (i.e.,mature basins).The pore pressure and therefore its gradient can be obtained from well log data as well are drilled.These pore pressure data are fundamental for the solution of engineering problems in drilling,well completions,production and reservoir engi- neering."}
{"text": "The constant value of 0.25 for Poisson's ratio versus depth reflects the geology and the rock mechanics of the mature sedimentary basin in the West Texas region. Since mature basins are well cemented,the rock columns of West Texas will act a compressible,brittle,elastic materials."}
{"text": "The Cenozoic portions of the Gulf Coast sedimen- tary basins are immature;therefore,little cementing of the sediments has taken place.Poisson's ratio varies with depth for such sedimentary columns,reflecting the variation of properties through the column.At great depth (i.e., approaching 20,000 ft),Poisson's ratio approaches that of incompressible,plastic materials (i.e.,0.5)[12]."}
{"text": "In general,Equation 2.5.20 can be used to approximate fracture pressure gradients.To obtain an adequate approx- imation for fracture pressure gradients,the pore pressure gradient must be determined from well log data.Also,the overburden stress gradient and Poisson's ratio versus depth must be known for the region."}
{"text": "There is a field operation method by which the frac- ture pressure gradient can be experimentally verified.Such tests are known as leak-off tests.The leak-off test will be discussed in Chapter 4."}
{"text": "2.5.7 Basic Engineering Soil Properties\n\nThe surface rock formations of the earth are continually exposed to the weathering process of the atmosphere that surrounds the earth.The weathering process through time can change the rock exposed at the surface.Such changes are both mechanical and chemical.The altered surface rock is often used by lifeforms,particularly by plant life that directly draws nourishment from minerals at the surface. As the weathering process proceeds at the surface of the earth,rock at the surface disintegrates into small separate particles and is carried off and deposited at various locations around the original rock.Some particles are carried great distances to the sea to become source sediments for new rock formations.Some particles move only a few feet or a mile or two to be deposited with fragments from other nearby rock locations.These weathered particles,once deposited on the surface of the earth in land locations,are often referred to as soil [14]."}
{"text": "To a farmer,soil is the substance that supports plant life."}
{"text": "Soil,from the engineering point of view,is defined as any unconsolidated material composed of discrete solid particles that has either liquids or gasesin the voids between the individual particles."}
{"text": "In general,soil overlays rock formations,and the soil is related to the rock since the rock was its source.Where the soil ends (in depth)and rock begins is not a well- defined interfaceBasically,the depth to which soil is found is that depth where excavation by land methods can be employed.The area where the removal of mate- rial requires drilling,wedging,and blasting is believed to be the beginning of rock (in the engineering sense) The engineering properties of soil are of importance to petroleum engineering because it is soil that the drilling engineer first encounters as drilling is initiated.But,more important,it is soil that must support the loads ofthe drilling rig through an appropriately designed foundation.Further the production engineer must support the well head sur- face equipment on soil through an appropriately designed foundation."}
{"text": "2.5.7.1 Soil Characteristics and Classification The engineer visualizes a soil mass as an ideal,real,physi- cal body incapable of resisting tensile stresses."}
{"text": "The ideal soil is defined as a loose,granular medium that is devoid of cohesion but possesses internal friction. In contrast,an ideal cohesive medium is one that is devoid of internal friction.Real soils generally fall between the foregoing two limiting definitions."}
{"text": "Soils can consist of rock,rock particles,mineral materi- als derived from rock formations,and organic matter."}
{"text": "● Bedrock is composed of competent,hard,rock for- mations that underlie soils.Bedrock is the foundation engineer's description of transition from soils to rock at depth.Such rock can be igneous,sedimentary,or metamorphic.Bedrock is very desirable for foundation placement."}
{"text": "Weathered rock is bedrock that is deteriorating due to the weathering process.Usually,this is confined to the upper layers of the bedrock."}
{"text": "● Boulders are rock fragments over 10 in.in diameter found in soils."}
{"text": "● Cobbles are rock fragments from 2-4 in.in diameter found in soils."}

{"text": "● Sand consists of rock particles from 0.05-2 mm in size."}

{"text": "● Clay,in one particle classification system,consists of inorganic particles less than 0.005 mm in size.In another system,clay is a fine-grained inorganic soil that can be made plastic by adjusting the water content.When dried,clay exhibits considerable strength (i.e.,clay loses its plasticity when dried and its strength when wetted). Also,it will shrink when dried and expand when mois- ture is added."}
{"text": "2.5.7.2 Index Properties of Soils\n\nEasily observed physical properties of soils often are useful indexes of behavior.These index properties include texture and appearance,specific weight,moisture content,consis- tency,permeability,compressibility,and shearing strength [14,15]."}

{"text": "1.Note:k',hydraulic conductivity,is used for water flow in rocks as well as in soils."}
{"text": "● Soil compressibility is important for foundation engi- neering because it indicates settlement.Settlement or deformation of the soil under the foundation occurs because of change of position of particles in a soil mass."}
{"text": "● Shearing Strength is the shear stress in a soil mass at failure of the soil mass (usually cracking),or when continuous displacement can occur at constant stress."}
{"text": "2.5.8.1 Site Investigations\n\nNumerous techniques are used for site investigations.The techniques vary in cost from relatively low-cost visual investigations to costly subsurface explorations and labora- tory tests [16,17]."}
{"text": "● Visual inspection is an essential primary step.Such inspections should provide data on surface soils,surface waters,and slopes."}
{"text": "● Probing,driving a rod or pipe into the soil and measur- ing the penetration resistance,obtains initial subsurface information.This is a low-cost method,but in general it is likely to supply inadequate information about sub- surface conditions,especially on the depth and nature of bedrock."}
{"text": "● Augers provide subsurface data by bringing up mate- rial for detailed examination.Augers disturb the soil; therefore,little or no information can be obtained on the character of the soil in its natural undisturbed state."}

{"text": "2.5.8.2 Laboratory Tests\n\nIn addition to the site investigations just described and the on-site tests which can be carried out through test pits and augering,often specific laboratory tests are required to iden- ify soils and determine their properties.Such laboratory tests are conducted on the soil samples that are recovered from various subsurface depths.These laboratory tests are used when there are questions as to the structural supporting capabilities of the soils at a particular site.Numerous types of laboratory tests are available that can aid the engineer in designing adequate foundation support for heavy or dynamic loads.In general,however,few tests are necessary for most foundation designs[14-17]."}

{"text": "2.7.1 Chemical Bonds and Polarity\n\nChemical compounds may be considered ionic or covalent. In an ionic compound,electrons are transferred from a more electropositive element,such as a metal,to a more electronegative element,such as a halide,or to a more complex structure,such as nitrate(NO₃).Common salt, NaCl,is an example of an ionic compound.Ionic com- pounds are usually soluble in water because the cation, in this case Na+,and the anion,Cl-,can dissociate and become solvated by the water.Many inorganic compounds are at least partly ionic.Ionic compounds tend to be good conductors of electricity.Their melting and boiling points are higher than those of covalent compounds."}

Carbon atoms can bond to each other to form chains and rings,and they can share one,two,or three pairs of electrons in each bond.These characteristics allow the formation of a wide variety of compounds.Chemists group these compounds into homologous series,families of compounds that contain a common functional group.Each member of a homologous series differs from the next by a one- carbon unit."}
{"text": "Nonpolar molecules such as H₂,N₂,O₂,I₂,and Cl₂ have zero dipole moments,because e=0.On the other hand,hydrogen fluoride,HF,has a large dipole moment of 1.75 Debye and so is strongly polar.Simple carbon compounds with symmetric arrangement of like atoms(e.g., methane,CH4,and carbon tetrachloride,CCl4)have zero dipole moments and so are nonpolar."}

{"text": "Enantiomers come about because of the tetrahedral arrangement of singly-bonded atoms around carbon.If four different groups are bonded to a carbon atom,that atom is a chiral center,and the chiral compound will have two enantiomeric forms.Molecules may have more than one chiral center.Sugars contain multiple chiral centers."}
{"text": "The formula or model is then rotated in space so that the lowest priority group is behind the chiral carbon.If the priority numbers of the other groups then increase counterclockwise,the enantiomer is designated R.If they increase clockwise,the enantiomer is designated S.The two enantiomers of2-butanol are shown below."}

{"text": "The principal classes of hydrocarbons found in crude oils are paraffins,cycloparaffins(naphthenes),and aromat- ics.Compounds containing N,S,or O and metals and also found in crude oil.The molecular weight distribution of a crude oil ranges from 16 for methane to several thousands for asphaltenes.The lower boiling point fractions of most crude oils are dominated by saturated hydrocarbons (i.e., paraffins and napthenes),whereas the higher boiling frac- tions and residuum contain large proportions of aromatics and N/O compounds.The sulfur content tends to increase with the boiling point."}
{"text": "A\"base\"designation is given in the refining industry to classify crude oils:(i)A paraffin-base crude contains predominantly paraffins and small amounts of naphthenes or asphalt.Upon distillation,it yields fine lubricating oils from the gas-oil fraction and paraffin wax from the solid residue.(ii)An asphalt-base crude contains mostly cyclic compounds (primarily naphthenes),which,upon distilla- tion,produce high yields of black,pitchlike,solid residue, asphalt,and heavy fuel oil.(ii)A mixed-base crude has characteristics intermediate between the above two cate- gories.(iv)An aromatic-base crude contains large amounts of low-molecular weight aromatics together with naph- thenes,and small amounts of asphalt and paraffins."}
{"text": "Tars and Asphalts are semisolid or solid substances."}
{"text": "They are also referred to as bitumens,waxes,and pitch. These materials consist of mixtures of complex organic molecules of high molecular weight.As with crude oils,an exact chemical analysis for identification and composition is impractical to perform on the solid deposits of petroleum."}
{"text": "Saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons found in petroleum include normal alkanes as well as branched alkanes(iso- alkanes).The paraffin content can vary widely from one crude oil to another.n-alkanes have been found throughout the boiling range of most crude oils,from n=1 to 78. Some waxy crudes contain higher alkanes,up to n=200. The pour point of a crude oil is strongly influenced by the amount and carbon-number distribution of n-alkanes present.For crude oils,it can range from -70 to 110°F (-57 to 43℃).Whereas n-alkanes tend to raise the pour point,other hydrocarbon types lower it."}
{"text": "All possible isoalkanes from C₄through Cg have been found in crude oils,along with several isomers of Cg and some of C10.Many isoprenoids(e.g.,pristane and phytane) which serve as biomarkers to the genesis of petroleum have been detected in significant concentrations.The 2-and 3- methyl alkanes and pristane appear to be the dominant isoparaffins in crude oils."}
{"text": "Cycloalkanes occur in varying amounts in crude oils The rings contain of five,six,or seven carbon atoms.Alkyl derivatives of cyclopentane and cyclohexane have been found,but not of cycloheptane.The most common naph- thenes are methyl-and dimethyl-substituted cyclopentane and cyclohexane.The amount of naphthenes can be greater than 50 wt%of a crude oil,with the lighter boiling frac- tions containing less and the heavier fractions containing more.Fused polycyclic aliphatic structures such as decalin (C1₀H₁8)become prevalent in the heavier fractions.Some of these multiring compounds may contain up to seven rings."}
{"text": "been reported to be present in crude oils.Alkynes and cycloalkynes are not commonly found in natural petroleum."}
{"text": "Aromatic content can vary considerably between crudes but rarely exceeds 15%of the total crude weight.The aromatic hydrocarbons appear throughout the boiling range but tend to be concentrated in the heavy fractions of petroleum,including the residuum.As a class,aromatics (e.g.,toluene and xylenes)have the highest octane ratings among hydrocarbons and hence are used as additives to gasoline and other fuel oils.They show the largest viscosity changes with temperature and are therefore undesirable in the lubricating oil range.With rising boiling point,the heavy fractions contain increasing amounts of complex polycyclic aromatic compounds that are difficult to characterize.Some polynuclear aromatic molecules such as 3,4-benzopyrene and benz[a]anthracene are carcinogens."}
{"text": "Compounds containing nitrogen,sulfur,and oxygen are usually abbreviated NSO compounds and are sometimes referred to as asphaltics.The residuum contains a high percentage of NSO compounds.The strong odor of crude oil is imported by NSO compounds."}
{"text": "All crude oils contain sulfur in one of several forms including elemental sulfur,hydrogen sulfide,carbonyl sulfide (COS),and in aliphatic and aromatic compounds. The amount of sulfur-containing compounds increases with an increase in the boiling point of the fraction.Most of these compounds have one sulfur atom per molecule,but certain aromatic and polynuclear aromatic molecules found in low concentrations in crude oil contain two and three sulfur atoms."}
{"text": "Alkyl thiols(mercaptans)with normal or branched alkyl groups and with the thiol group in a primary,secondary or tertiary location have been found in petroleum,together with cycloalkyl thiols having rings of five or six carbon atoms.Continuous chain or branched alkyl sulfides and cyclic sulfides with four or five carbon atoms in their rings have been detected.Mixed alkyl cycloalkyl sulfides have also been found.Alkylpolycyclic sulfides contain- ing one to eight cycloparaffin rings were identified in certain crudes.Aromatic compounds of sulfur include thio- phenes,their benzo-and dibenzo-derivatives,and benzon- aphthothiophenes.Thioindanes and alkylaryl sulfides are also present."}
{"text": "In general,mercaptans are more malodorous than sul- fides and hydrogen sulfide.The presence of significant amounts of sulfur can poison catalyst for the refining of crude oil."}
{"text": "Most crude oils contain nitrogen;a large proportion of it occurs in the high boiling fractions and in the residuum.Examples of the nitrogen compounds present in petroleum include mono-,di-,and tri-alkylpyridines, quinoline and alkyl substituted quinolines,tetrahydro- quinolines and dialkylbenz[h]quinolines.Carbazole and methyl-through decyl-substituted carbazoles have also been identified.The high boiling fractions from one crude oil contained a variety of nitrogen compound types (in excess of 0.1 wt%concentration)that included indoles,carbazoles, benzcarbazoles,pyridines,quinolines,and phenanthridines. Compounds containing both nitrogen and oxygen,such as amides,hydroxypyridines and hydroxyquinolines,as well as compounds containing two nitrogens such as azain- doles and azacarbazoles,were also found.Other molecular types including pyrroles,isoquinolines,benzoquinolines, and benzologues of acridine may be present in crude oil. Porphyrins are observed in the residuum,usually in asso- ciation with metals.Certain aromatic nitrogen compounds (e.g.,pyridines,quinolines)can cause coking on acid cata- lysts during petroleum processing."}
{"text": "Most crude oils contain only small amounts of oxygen."}
{"text": "Oxygen compounds are mainly carboxylic acids,includ- ing straight-chain fatty acids,branched-chain acids,naph- thenic acids,and dicarboxylic acids.Other molecular types observed in the higher boiling fractions include furans and their benzo-,dibenzo-,and benzonaphtho-derivatives.Oxy- gen may also be present in the form of phenols,alcohols, esters,and ketones and in combination with nitrogen."}
{"text": "In the asphaltene fraction,pure hydrocarbons become rare at molecular weights above 800,and polar functional groups become common.Asphaltenes exist as a dispersion of colloidal particles in an oily medium.Their molecular weight can be as high as 200,000.A typical asphaltene molecule has 10-20 condensed aromatic and naphthenic rings,with both alkyl and cycloalkyl substituted side chains The observed polar functional groups in the high molecular weight compounds include carboxylic acids,amides,phe- nols,carbazoles and pyridines."}
{"text": "The metals present in crude oils usually exist in com- plexes of cyclic organic molecules—called porphyrins.The parent structure of the porphyrins is the tetramethene- tetrapyrrole ring(C₂oH₄N4).In a metalloporphyrin,the transition metal atom is held at the center of the porphyrin ring by coordination with the four pyrrole N atoms.Nickel and vanadium are present in petroleum in concentrations of less than 1ppb to about 1000 ppm,in combined form with porphyrins.Some of the lighter metalloporphyrins are volatile,while the high molecular weight porphyrins appear in the nonvolatile residuum.When oil deposits occur together with saline water,the produced oil-water emulsions contain soluble salts of sodium,calcium,and magnesium. Other metals may be present in the inorganic state as suspended solids in the produced fluids along with any clays or mineral matter derived from the rock matrix and piping."}
{"text": "The pour point represents the lowest temperature at which the liquid fuel willpour.Thisisa useful consideration in the transport of fuels through pipelines.To determine the pour point,an oil sample contained in a test tube is heated up to 115°F (46℃)until the paraffin waxes have melted.The tube is then cooled in a bath kept at about 20°F (11℃)below the estimated pour point.The temperature at which the oil does not flow when the tube is horizontally positioned is termed the pour point."}
{"text": "The aniline cloud point is a measure of the paraffinicity of a fuel oil.A high value denotes ahighly paraffinic oil,and a low value indicates an aromatic,a naphthenic,or a highly cracked oil.The flash point represents the temperature to which a liquid fuel can be heated before a flash appears on its surface upon exposure to a test flame under specified conditions.A knowledge of the flash point is needed to ensure safe handling and storage without fire hazards."}

The placement of these wells and the selection of their respective production rates within a particular reservoir or field must be planned carefully.The pattern of well locations and production rates should be designed so that the largest fraction of the in-place petroleum can eventually be recovered even though the maximum recoverable fraction of the oil or natural gas in place will not reach 100 percent.

{"text": "The creation of these device designs is somewhat abstract with regards to providing products for the \"needs of society.\"The device designs are in support of an industry which is vital to society's operation.Thus,the designer of a device for the petroleum industry designs,in a sense, for society's needs.In the petroleum industry,suppliers of hardware and services for operating companies function more in the area of designing devices than in the design and supply of systems (or processes)that produce natural petroleum resources."}
{"text": "In the petroleum industry,the term system and process are often considered synonymous.This is basically because engineering designers in the industry create \"systems\"that will carry out needed operational \"processes\"(e.g.,water- flood project)."}
{"text": "2.8.3.3 Role of Models\n\nOnce the problem has been defined and the decision has been made to proceed with a design effort(device or system),the conceptual designs and/or parts of the device or system are modeled,both mathematically and physically. Engineers design by creating models that they can visualize, think about,and rearrange until they believe they have an adequate design concept for practical application.There- fore,modeling is fundamental to successful engineering design efforts and is used to predict the operating charac- teristics of a particular design concept in many operational situations."}
{"text": "Dimensional Analysis.In the design of rather simple devices or systems,dimensional analysis can be used in conjunction with physical model experimental investiga- tions to gain insight into the performance of a particular design concept.It is usually possible to define the perfor- mance of a simple device or system with a certain number of well chosen geometric and performance related variables that describe the device or system.Once these variables have been selected,dimensional analysis can be used to:\n\n1.Reduce the number of variables by combining the vari- ables into a few dimensionless terms.These dimension- less terms can be used to assist in the design of a physical model that,in turm,can be used for experimentation (on an economic scale)that will yield insight into the prototype device or system."}
{"text": "3.Develop device or system designs utilizing the descrip- tive governing relationships between the dimensionless terms(and subsequently between the variables)that are similar to those of the tested physical model,but are the dimensional scale of the desired device or system."}
{"text": "Dimensional analysis techniques are especially useful for manufacturers that make families of products that vary in size and performance specifications.Often it is not economic to make full-scale prototypes of a final product (e.g.,dams,bridges,communication antennas,etc.).Thus, the solution to many of these design problems is to create small scale physical models that can be tested in similar operational environments.The dimensional analysis terms combined with results of physical modeling form the basis for interpreting data and development of full-scale proto- type devices or systems.Use of dimensional analysis in fluid mechanics is given in the following example."}
{"text": "Example 2.8.1\n\nTo describe laminar flow of a fluid,the unit shear stress T is some function of the dynamic viscosity μ(lb/ft²),and the velocity difference dV(ft/s)between adjacent laminae that are separated by the distance dy(ft).Develop a relationship for t in terms of the variables μ,dV and dy."}
{"text": "Buckingham IT.The Buckingham IT theorem is some- what more sophisticated than the dimensional analysis tech- nique.Although directly related to the dimensional analysis technique,Buckingham T is usually used in design situ- ations where there is less understanding of exactly which performance characteristics are ultimately important for prototype design.The Buckingham IT theorem is generally more applicable to the design of complex devices or sys- tems.In particular,Buckingham ITis usually used when the number of dimensionless terms needed to describe a device or system exceeds four.The fundamental theorem is..."}
{"text": "“ifan equation is dimensionally homogeneous(and contains all the essential geometry and performance variables)it can be reduced to a relationship among a complete set of dimensionless terms ofthe variables. \"\n\nApplications of the Buckingham IT theorem results in the formulation of dimensionless terms called I ratios.These T ratios have no relation to the number 3.1416."}
{"text": "2.8.3.4 Analysis,Synthesis and the Creative Art of Design\n\nEvolution was an early engineering design methodology. This methodology (basically trial and error)is a primitive form of physical modeling.Prior to the development of more sophisticated engineering design methodologies,the only method to develop a useful device or system was to fabricate a conceptual design and put it into operation. If the design failed to meet the desired specifications, then the failure was analyzed and the appropriate changes made to the design and another product fabricated and placed into operation.However,design by evolution was not very economical and as engineering design methodologies were developed that would allow for design choices to be made without resorting to costly fabrication,design engineers were driven to accept these new methodolo- gies.Modern engineering design methodologies are based on the design engineer's ability to appropriately utilize analysis and synthesis to create the desired device or system [7-10]."}
{"text": "Once the designer has developed confidence in the analysis techniques pertaining to the various parts of a design concept(whether derived from mathematical models or from physical models),the designer can begin the process of synthesis.Synthesis is basically the combining of the analyses (and any other pertinent information)to allow for the design concept to be viewed as a whole.In general,it is during the process of synthesis that the creative capabil- ities of the individual designer are utilized the most.The designer utilizes knowledge of the performance specifica- tions,results from modeling,economics,experience with other similar projects,aesthetics (if needed),and intuition to create many easy-to-make choices concerning the design. Thus,the synthesis process often allows the designer to proceed to the final design of a device or system with little iteration."}
{"text": "Creativity in engineering is the art portion of engineer- ing.It is a unique sum of an individual design engineer's experience,practice and intuition with a flair for the aes- thetic.Creativity can be found in any part of the engineering design process,but it is usually in the synthesis portion of the process that a designer's aptitude for creativity can make the difference between a mediocre design and a truly successful design.Thus,creativity is an essential part of the engineering method."}
{"text": "Physical realizability is often the most difficult of the above three corollary questions to answer.In general,to answer this question it is necessary to know;1)whether the materials and components required by the engineer- ing design are available;and 2)whether the manufactur- ing (and/or fabrication)techniques and skilled craftsmen needed to fabricate the product are also available.These two assessments are difficult to make because they often involve the projection of future technological developments."}
{"text": "The service companies provide a supporting role to the producing companies.They supply the products and services that allow the producing companies to explore, drill and complete wells,and produce the petroleum from the earth.Once the petroleum has been brought to the surface,the service companies also assist in providing safe transportation of the petroleum to refining facilities. There is a great variety of service companies.Many service companies are dedicated only to supporting the producing companies(e.g.,geophysical surveying)while other service companies supply products and services to a number of primary industries."}
{"text": "1.Evaluate two or more manufacturing techniques."}
{"text": "2.If components of a new system design are available from sources outside the company,then an evaluation must be made as to whether it is more economic to buy these components from outside or to manufacture them within."}
{"text": "3.Engineers will constantly seek ways of reducing manu- facturing costs.As these design modifications are made, economic evaluations of changes must be made."}
{"text": "4.An overall economic evaluation must be made to ensure that the contemplated project for petroleum development will recover sufficient capital to pay for the total cost of development,installation and assem- bly effort of the company.Further,the capital returm must yield a financial return consistent with the over- all company risk involved.Thus,it is very important that the petroleum engineer designing a recovery sys- tem understand the company's evaluation criteria that will be used by management in judging whether a new project is to go forward.Chapter 7(Petroleum Economics)has detailed discussions of general engi- neering economics and product (or project)evaluation criteria."}
{"text": "2.8.4.2 Service Company Product Design\n\nIn general,engineering design of devices or systems takes place throughout the petroleum industry.However,service industries are responsible for supplying(thus,designing and manufacturing/fabricating)the vast majority of the devices and systems(and often the personnel to operate them)that are utilized by the producing companies.Therefore,the service companies do for more traditional device and system engineering design than the producing companies (e.g., geophysical survey tool design,drilling fluid design,drill bit design,cement design and placement system design, production pump design,etc.).Because of the complexity of the petroleum industry,these engineering design activities cover all three of the basic engineering fields(e.g.,mechan- ical arts and sciences,the chemical arts and sciences,and the electrical arts and sciences)."}
{"text": "2.8.4.3 Producing Company Project Design\n\nThe producing companies are responsible for carrying out the complex operations of exploration,drilling and completion,and production.These projects vary from the seeking oil and gas deposits at 15,000ft of depth in the continental U.S.to seeking similar deposits at 15,000 ft below some remote ocean floor.The engineering plan- ning and design of these complex projects is a special class of systems engineering design.Although dealing with quite different technologies,production operations have similar concerns related to overall system outcome as do large mining projects or large civil engineering projects (such as the construction of a dam or large transporta- tion system).Thus,the engineering projects design and management aspects of systems engineering are of pri- mary interest to the engineering staffs of the producing companies [12]."}

{"text": "2.8.6.1 Trade Secrets\n\nTrade secrets are creative works (usually methods,pro- cesses,or designs)that are not covered by the strict defi- nition of \"an invention\"required for a legal patent,or they are actual inventions that a company or individual does not want to expose to public scrutiny through the patent process (since the published patent must contain a written description of the invention)."}
{"text": "Companies and individuals have the legal right to protect and maintain trade secrets.The key point,however,is that trade secrets must be something that can be kept secret. Anyone who discovers a trade secret via his or her own efforts may use it.The only legal protection for trade secrets is against persons who obtain these secrets by stealing them and then using them,or after having been entrusted with these secrets as a necessary part of their job and then using them [7,18]."}
{"text": "The term trade secret is well understood by U.S.courts and is a legal term.In general,the U.S.courts have strongly upheld the protection of company-or individual-owned trade secrets.Cases against ex-employees or others who have obtained trade secrets by stealth are relatively easy to prosecute(compared to patent,trademark,or copyright infringement cases)."}
{"text": "A U.S.Patent is a legal document granted only to the individual inventor that allows the inventor to have the exclusive right for a limited time to exclude all others from making,using or selling his or her invention in the U.S. There are restrictions to this statement.An inventor does not have an absolute right to use his or her patented invention, if doing so would also involve making,using or selling another invention patented by someone else.The time limits for the exclusive use of an invention by the inventor are fixed by low and can only be extended in special circumstances. After this time limit expires,anyone may make and sell the invention without permission of the inventor.There are three legal categories of patents;utility patents,design patents, and plant patents."}
{"text": "Utility Patents.Utility patents are granted to individuals only who have invented or discovered any new and useful method,process,machine,manufacture,or matter compo- sition.These patents must be useful to society(have utility). A utility patent has a total time limit for exclusive use by the inventor of 17 years."}
{"text": "Design Patents. Design patents are granted to individu- als who have invented new,original and ornamental designs for an article of manufacture.A design patent has a total time limit for exclusive use by the inventor of 14 years."}
{"text": "Plant Patents. Plant patents are granted to individuals who have invented or discovered and a sexually reproduced a new and distinct variety of plant.This includes mutants, hybrids,and newly found seedlings.A plant patent has a total time limit for exclusive use by the inventor of 17 years."}
{"text": "Only the actual inventor may apply for a patent(utility, design,or plant patent).Once a patent has been obtained, the patent can be sold or mortgaged.Also,the owner of a patent may assign part or all interest in the patent to another individual or a company or other business entity. The owner of a patent may also grant licenses to others (either individuals or business entities),to make,use or sell the invention."}
{"text": "2.Keep records that document when and what was invented.It is important that accurate records are kept showing your original sketches with a disclosure state- ment describing what and how your invention works. It is useful to have someone witness this disclosure document and verify the date that this invention took place.It is often during this step that the invention concept is either modeled (mathematical or physical or both)and tested.Thus,accurate records of these analyzes or test results should also be kept.In the U.S.it is the first to invent that willobtain a patent in the event of two individuals inventing the same thing.Keep the disclosure document secret until the patent application is submitted to the patent office."}
{"text": "3.Search the existing patents relating to the invention. Carry out an extensive patent search of existing patents to find patents that are related to the new invention. Make sure the new invention is novel and unobvious and is not in conflict with existing patents.A search of U.S.patents can be made in the Search Room of the U.S.Patent and Trademark Office in Crystal Plaza, 2021 Jefferson Davis Highway,Arlington Virginia.An individual inventor or a patent attorney may hire agents that will carry out thorough patent searches.In addition, every state in the U.S.has a U.S.Patent Depository Library where patent searches may be conducted by private individuals."}
{"text": "4.Prepare and file the patent application documents.This document is called a \"specification.\"The specification must be clear enough so that anyone skilled in the sub- ject matter of the invention could recreate your invention and use it.In the written portion of the specifications the inventor must state the claims of the invention. These claims must show that the invention is novel and unobvious.Also,where applicable,illustrations must accompany the specification.There are filing fees for patent applications and if the application is successful there are maintenance fees to keep the patent in force. Literature describing patent applications and how they are to be submitted can be obtained from the Com- missioner of Patents and Trademarks,Washington,D. C.,20231.This is also the address to submit properly prepared patent applications."}
{"text": "Infringement of a patent occurs when an individual or company makes,uses,or sells an nvention without the permission of the inventor,assignee,owner,or licensee.The U.S.courts will award damages and place penalties on the infringer.But patent infringement cases are very costly and\n\ntime consuming."}
{"text": "It should be noted that all other countries grant patents to inventors that are the first to submit patent applications to their respective patent offices.We are the only country the grants a patent to the first to invent(not the first to the patent office).However,in 2003 the U.S.may change to the \"first to the patent office\"method of granting patents."}

{"text": "The spark-ignition cycle engine uses volatile liquids or gases as fuel.Such engines have compression ratios from 6:1 to 12:1.liquid gasoline is the most common fuel for this cycle,especially for automobile,truck,and airplane engines.Large stationery engines usually use commercial gases such as natural gas,produces gas,or coal gas.All engines operating on this cycle use carburetors,gas-mixing valves,or fuel injection systems to mix the volatile fuel with the appropriate volume of air for subsequent combustion. This mixing can be carried out prior to the mixture being placed in the cylinder of the engine,or mixed directly in the cylinder."}
{"text": "The compression-ignition cycle engine uses low volatile fuel.These are typically fuel oils.The compression ratios for these engine are from 11.5:1 to 22:1.These engines are used to power large trucks and buses.They are also used for large engines.The compression-ignition cycle engine usually is equipped with a fuel injection system which allows the fuel to be mixed with air directly in the cylinders of the engine."}
{"text": "The internal combustion four-stroke engine,which is the predominant engine in oilfield applications,requires four piston strokes (or two crankshaft revolutions)for each cycle.In a downward stroke,the intake valve is opened and the combustible mixture is brought into the cylinder. In an upward stroke the fuel-air mixture is compressed and ignited near the top of the stroke.This forces the piston downward (to provide power).In the next upward stroke the exhaust valve is opened and the spent gases are forced from the cylinder.In the following downward stroke,the cycle is repeated with the opening of the intake valve."}

{"text": "The power convertor must provide the AC motor with low-harmonic voltage waveform and simultaneously allow the amplitude to be adjusted.This avoids magnetic satura- tion of the motor as the frequency is adjusted.For constant torque,from maximum speed to base speed,the voltage is adjusted proportional to frequency.Above base speed, the motor is usually operated at constant horsepower.In this region the voltage is held constant and the flux density declines.Also,the convertor must limit the starting current, ensure operation at favorable slip,and provide a path for reverse power flow during motor slowdown."}
{"text": "Inverters are designed with various power semiconduc- tor arrangements.Power semiconductor elements of the inverter operate like switches by synthesizing the motor voltage waveform from segments of the DC bus voltage.

{"text": "Primary-Voltage-Control-AC Motor Driver. Induction motor torque at any slip s is proportional to primary V² . Rotor-power dissipation is equal to s times the air-gap power.These two relationships define the boundary of oper- ation of an induction motor with primary voltage control of speed.As the speed is reduced(s increased)at constant torque,the air-gap power remains fixed,but the power divides between rotor circuit dissipation and mechanical shaft power."}
{"text": "The rating of the solid-state equipment depends upon the torque requirement as a function of speed.For a constant- torque drive,the auxiliary system at starting must handle the full motor rated power.For pump drives,the auxiliary system ratings are reduced considerably.The convertor operates with phase-controlled firing signals from the sup- ply line,such as for a DC drive rectifier and develops relatively constant-speed characteristics.The stator-rotor winding ratio is made slightly larger than unity to ensure that power flow is toward the supply line at the lowest speed (e.g.,at stall)."}
{"text": "Solid-State DC Drives. The controlled-thyristor rectifier and separate-field DCmotor is the solid-state motor drive in greatest use.The combination provides control over at least a 10:1 speed range,plus an additional two to three times by field weakening.Depending upon the power level,the rectifier is operated directly from the AC supply lines,or via a transformer.Typical speed regulation of±2%can be accomplished with a single control system.The horsepower and speed limitations are set by the DC motor,not by the semiconductor rectifiers.The DC motor and rectifier can be combined to any required power level."}

{"text": "Precision tools are used in the manufacture of roller chains,and a high degree of accuracy is maintained.The chain is made up of links,pins,and bushings,all fabricated from a high grade of steel,with the pins and the bushings ground to ensure accuracy of pitch."}
{"text": "Roller chains can generally be furnished not only in single but in multiple widths as well.The use of the multiple roller chain makes possible a shorter pitch without sacrific- ing high-power capacity.Because the shorter pitch permits a greater number of teeth for an allowable sprocket diameter and a reduction in drive weight,quieter and smoother operation are obtained.The multiple chains may be operated at the same speed as a single chain of the same pitch. Theoretically,the power that can be transmitted by them is equal to the capacity of the single chain multiplied by the number of stands,but actually this quantity is usually reduced about 10%."}
{"text": "Sprockets.T o secure full advantage of the modern roller chain,it should be operated on sprockets having accurately machined teeth,the profile of which has been specified or approved by the ANSI [7].This profile,which is made up of circular arcs,is designed to compensate for the increase in pitch due to natural wear and thereby provides maximum efficiency throughout the life of the sprocket."}
{"text": "be used at high speeds and that 19 or 21-tooth sprockets are even better.The upper limit should be kept at about 125.It is considered good practice to use an odd number of teeth on the smaller sprocket.For a speed ratio of 7:1 or larger, a double-reduction drive often may be actually cheaper and undoubtedly will give longer life."}
{"text": "In general,four types of sprockets are available for roller chains.They are steel plate without hubs,cast iron or steel with hubs on one or both sides,split type,double-duty type."}
{"text": "Shaft Centers. It can be readily seen that on any chain drive the minimum center distances must be more than one- half the sum of the diameters of the two sprocket wheels. Experience has shown that best results are usually obtained when the center distance between shafts is 30 to 50 times the chain pitch.Forty times the chain pitch is about normal, and 80 times the pitch is maximum.In highly pulsating loads,20 to 30 times the pitch is more nearly the correct center distance.Center distances of 10-12 ft are permissible with finished steel roller chains operated at moderate speeds without the use of idlers.On distances greater than this, an idler should be used to eliminate the possibility of swaying or flopping,which may cause the chain to jump the sprocket.When idlers are used,they should be placed on the slack strand of the chain.The number of teeth in the idler should be the largest possible and preferably not less than the number in the smaller sprocket of the drive."}
{"text": "To guide silent chains on their sprockets,a number of arrangements are used.They can,however,all be grouped under one of two heads:flanged links as part of the chain, or flanged jaws of the sprockets."}
{"text": "The plate flange is used on the drive sprocket in those cases where heavy guiding action is expected such as is sometimes encountered in high-power devices."}
{"text": "Silent chains are furnished in pitches varying from3 to 3 in.and in weights capable of transmitting from a fraction of a horsepower up to several thousand.They can be operated at speeds up to 3,500 ft/min,but where long life and low maintenance are desired,they should be held between 1,200 and 1,500 ft/min.Although they can be successfully operated at speeds below 1,200 ft/min, when extremely low speeds are required,it is usually more economical to use the roller chain."}
{"text": "Sprockets. Since the silent chain has not had the same wide usage as roller chains and because of the different types of construction that have been employed,there has been but little standardization of specializations.Each manufacturer has more or less carried out its own design and ratings,with the result that the sprockets to be used with this type of chain vary accordingly."}
{"text": "As a protection for equipment against overload,sprock- ets are sometimes provided for silent chains with a\"shear- ing pin\"or a \"break-pin hub.\"A pin of a known strength is used,and an overload of sufficient magnitude shears the pin and leaves the plate free to turn on the hub.After the overload condition is remedied,a new pin may be easily inserted and the drive again made ready to operate."}
{"text": "Shaft Centers.As in roller chains,the minimum distance between shaft centers for silent chains must,in order to provide tooth clearance,be greater than half the sum of the two sprocket diameters.On large-speed reductions, experience has shown that the center distance should not be less than eight-tenths the difference in diameters of the two sprockets."}
{"text": "The Ewart links are usually cast in one piece with no separate bushings or pins.The material used is generally malleable iron,although steel is also extensively employed. As a general rule the maximum speed at which this type of chain is operated is about 400 ft/min,and even at that speed it is apt to be quite noisy.Because the links used in this chain are not machined and the pitch is not very uniform,the teeth of the sprockets used with them are,in turn,generally not machined."}
{"text": "improved or modified offset link can be used for more severe service conditions,but its safe maximum speed should,however,not exceed 400 f/min.The offset link chain with bushing is known as the API chain.These chains are in only three nominal sizes,3 in.,3gin.,and 4 in.In general,the use of this older type of chain is not recommended."}
{"text": "3.2.2.5 Design Consideration\n\nThere are design considerations for the various chain power transmission applications that are common to nearly all chain types [5].These are discussed in the following."}
{"text": "Roller Chains. These chains are primarily selected for low and medium-speed service and for conveyor work,although roller chains are sometimes used for higher speeds because they operate more smoothly and quietly."}
{"text": "The factors that will be discussed are often overlooked or misunderstood when applying chain.Other factors to be considered are found in chain manufacturers'catalogs along with chain sizes,sprocket types,and engineering examples."}
{"text": "For silent chain drives,pinions with 21 teeth or more are recommended for general applications and at least 25 teeth are recommended for high-speed applications.The recommended minimum is 17 teeth."}
{"text": "When space limits the diameter of the larger wheel,it may be necessary to selecta wider chain witha smaller pitch to obtain a desirable number of teeth in the pinion."}
{"text": "Small roller-chain wheels should be hardened when used on moderate and high-speed drives,very low-speed heavily loaded drives,and when operating under abrasive conditions or when the drive ratio is greater than 4:1.Steel silent chain pinions should be hardened."}
{"text": "Drive Ratio. Ratios in excess of 7:1 are generally not recommended for roller chains.If greater speed reduction is required,it is desirable and usually more economical to compound two or more drives."}
{"text": "Properly engineered silent chain drives having ratios as great as 12:1 will perform satisfactorily.However,it might be more economical to consider a compound drive where the ratio is 8:1 or larger."}
{"text": "Wheel Centers. To avoid interference,wheel centers must be more than one-half the sum of the wheel outside diame- ters.Where ratios are 2:1 to 7:1,a center distance equal to the diameter of the large wheel plus one-half the diameter of the small wheel is recommended.Drives so proportioned will have ample chain wrap on the small wheel.A chain wrap of 90°is regarded as an absolute minimum for load- carrying sprocket wheels,and 120°or more of wrap is considered desirable."}
{"text": "Where maintenance service is infrequent,a counter- weighted,spring-loaded,or automatic idler adjustment is best suited to promote long chain life.Manually adjusted idlers,if not periodically checked for proper chain tension- ing,may become a destructive source in the drive system."}
{"text": "A hardened-steel or hardwood shoe bearing against the back of the chain is another method of controlling chain tension.The method is satisfactory for small horsepower drives operating on fixed centers at slow or moderate speed with ample lubrication."}
{"text": "Offset couplers may be used to adjust chain tension or chain length when other methods are not feasible.This is done by removing a section of chain having one more pitch than the offset coupler and inserting the coupler in its place. Drive Types. Variable-speed drives may be selected on a chain-strength basis when operating with infrequent high chain loads such as from a torque converter,variable-speed motor,or multispeed transmission."}
{"text": "Speed-increasing drives should have at least 23 teeth in the smaller,faster running wheel.If possible,the taut span of the chain should be on top."}
{"text": "Vertical center drives require some form of chain ten- sioning or means for center adjustment to assure satisfactory operation and normal life.This is particularly important when the small wheel is in the lower position."}
{"text": "Fixed center drives should be selected on a conservative basis."}
{"text": "The method of application is primarily dictated by chain speed and the relative shaft positions.Some recommended methods are given below."}
{"text": "Manual Lubrication. This method is recommended for small horsepower drives with low chain speeds.Open run- ning chains should not be exposed to abrasive dirt."}
{"text": "There must be sufficient disk speed to throw the oil.Fig- ure 3.2.26 indicates the amount of oil delivered at various shaft speeds."}
{"text": "Forced lubrication is recommended for large- horsepower drives,heavily loaded drives,high-speed drives, or where splash and disk lubrication cannot be used.An oil pump—capacity about 1 gal/min—supplies a continuous spray of oil to the inside of the lower span of chain.The circulation of the lubricant aids in the dissipation of heat and results in a well-lubricated,cooler operating device."}
{"text": "Calculations. For a simple two-sprocket drive,the follow- ing guidelines for the initial design may be used [2]."}
{"text": "3.With large ratios,the angle of contact becomes smaller and the number of teeth engaged with the chain decreases.For angles less than 120°,θ increasingly becomes a critical factor in the design of chain drives."}
{"text": "with an odd number of teeth in each sprocket,will minimize wear."}
{"text": "6.When the center distance exceeds 60 pitches,a long chain will be needed and a manufacturer's representative should be consulted."}
{"text": "Equation 3.2.21 does not often result in an even number of pitches.Thus,the results must be rounded off to a whole number,preferably an even whole number to avoid the specification of an offset link chain."}
{"text": "When several sprockets are used,center distances and chain lengths are best found by means of accurate engineer- ing layouts and calculations."}
{"text": "3.2.2.6 Design Data\n\nIn what follows,the pertinent design data are given for the roller chain,silent chain,and the offset link chain(API chain)."}
{"text": "4Rotary countershaft and finaldrives have benefited only slightly from experience because too little has been known about rotary horsepowers through the years."}
{"text": "5Auxiliary brake chain drives have been omitted because of the indefinite nature of the load.Each manufacturer has established successful drives, but these are suited to specific conditions which cannot be reduced to simple terms.Most such drives violate the rules of chain speeds and loads and are successful only because of the short duration of use and deviation from calculated loads.It is recommended that the drawworks manufacturer be consulted."}

{"text": "3.3.2 General Calculations\n\nThere are several important calculations that are needed to properly evaluate and select the appropriate positive displacement pump[1,4-7]."}
{"text": "3.3.3 Reciprocating Pumps\n\nThe piston plunger pump is the simplest form of a positive displacement pump.These pumps can be powered by a variety of prime movers,internal combustion engines,and electric motors(and in some cases,powered by a gas turbine motor).In such applications,the separate pump unit is connected to the prime mover by a power transmission."}
{"text": "The capacity of a pump is determined by the number of plungers or pistons and the size of these elements(bore and stroke).A reciprocating pump is usually designed for a spe- cific volumetric rate capacity and pressure capability.These factors are set by the application.Once the volumetric rate capacity and pressure capability are known,a designer can determine the plunger piston bore and stroke the rotation speed range and the power of the prime mover needed to complete the system."}
{"text": "Reciprocating pumps are fabricated in both horizontal and vertical configurations."}
{"text": "3.3.3.1 Single-Acting Pump\n\nA single-acting pump has only one power(and discharge) stroke for its pistons.Such a pump brings fluid into its chamber through the inlet or suction value or the piston is drawn backward to open the chamber.To discharge the fluid,the inlet valve is closed and the outlet valve opened as the piston is forced forward to push the fluid from the chamber into the discharge line.The piston motion is accomplished by a rotating crankshaft that is connected to the piston by a piston rod much like an internal combustion piston engine.The rotating crankshaft of the pump is rotated by the rotational power of the prime mover (through a transmission)[7]."}
{"text": "The single-action pump is usually available with three, five and even seven pistons.The odd number of pistons allows the pump to be rotationally balanced,and the use of at least three pistons reduces the discharge pulsation of these single-acting pumps.A three piston pump single- action pump is called a triplex pump.A five piston,or seven piston single-acting pump is called a multiplex pump."}
{"text": "Double-acting pumps are usually available with one or two pistons."}
{"text": "A one-piston double-action pump is called a double- acting simplex(since there are older single-action steam and pneumatic driven simplex pumps)\n\nA two piston double-action pump is called a duplex pump."}
{"text": "3.3.3.4 Calculations\n\nThere are several important calculations that are needed in order to properly evaluate and select the appropriate reciprocating piston pump [1].These calculations are used in conjunction with Equations 3.3.1-3.3.6."}
{"text": "The stuffing box loss lb is usually negligible."}
{"text": "The valve loss lyis the loss due to the flow of fluid back through the valve during closing.This is of the order of 0.02 to 0.10 depending on the valve design."}
{"text": "q=Va(1-S)N (3.3.7)\n\nwhere Va is the displacement of the pumps piston in in.³,S is the slip fraction,and N is the speed of the pump in rpm."}
{"text": "In general,rotary pumps with discharge pressure of upto 100 psi are considered low-pressure pumps.Rotary pumps with pressure between 100 and 500 psi are considered moderate-pressure pumps.Pumps with pressure beyond 500 psi are considered to be high-pressure pumps."}
{"text": "Rotary pumps with volume capacities up to 50 gal/min are considered to be small-volume capacity pumps.Pumps with volume capacities from 50 to 500 gal/min are moderate-volume capacity pumps.And pumps with volume capacities beyond 500 gal/min are large-volume capacity pumps."}

{"text": "Pump horsepower P is the power actually imparted to the fluid by the rotary pump in Equation 3.3.1."}
{"text": "3.3.5 Centrifugal Pumps\n\nThe centrifugal pump is the most important pump of the dynamic class of pumps for the oil and gas industry.Other pumps in this class are covered in other references [1,4]."}
{"text": "3.3.5.1 Centrifugal Pump Classifications\n\nCentrifugal pumps with diffusion vanes are called diffusion pumps or,more recently,vertical turbine pumps.Those pumps with volute casings are called volute pumps."}
{"text": "Centrifugal pumps can also be classified by the design of the impeller.Centrifugal pumps may have radial-flow impellers,axial-flow impellers,and mixed-flow impellers (both radial-flow and axial-flow)."}
{"text": "Pump impellers are further classified as to the inlet flow arrangement such as single suction(which has a single inlet on one side)and double suction(which has a double inlet on each side of the impeller)."}
{"text": "Impellers can be further classified with regard to their physical design:a closed impeller has shrouds or sidewalls enclosing the fluid flow,an open impeller has no shrouds or sidewalls,and a semiopen impeller is a mix of the closed and open design."}
{"text": "Another centrifugal pump classification is whether the pump is asingle-stage pump(the pressure head is developed by a single impeller)or a multistage pump (the pressure head is developed by two or more impellers)."}
{"text": "Centrifugal pumps can be further classified by physical design or axially split,radially split and whether the axis of rotation of the impeller(s)is vertical or horizontal.Horizon- tal pumps can be classified according as end suction,side suction,bottom suction,and top suction."}
{"text": "In applications,centrifugal pumps can be supplied with liquid via piping,or the pump may be submerged.Vertical pumps are called dry-pit or wet-pit types.The wet-pit pump (submerged)discharges up through a pipe system to some point above the pump."}
{"text": "3.3.5.2 Calculations\n\nThere are important calculations that are needed to properly evaluate and select the appropriate centrifugal pump[6]."}
{"text": "There are several similar relationships for centrifugal pumps that can be used if the effects of viscosity of the pumped fluid can be neglected.These relate the operating performance of any centrifugal pump for one set of oper- ating conditions to the pump at another set of operating conditions,say conditions,and conditions 2."}

{"text": "Air or gas compressors are very similar in design and operation to liquid pumps discussed earlier.The air and gas compressor is a mover of compressed fluids; the pumps are movers of basically incompressible fluids (i.e.,liquids)."}
{"text": "In general,positive displacement compressors are best suited for handling high-pressure ratios (i.e.,about 200),but with only moderate volumetric flow rates (i.e.,up to about 10³actual cfm).Dynamic compressors are best suited for handling large volumetric flow rates (i.e.,up to about 106 actual cfm),but with only moderate pressure ratios (i.e., about 20)."}
{"text": "Thus,the positive displacement compressors are nor- mally applied to industrial operations where the volumetric flow rate is critical and the pressure ratio is a variable.The dynamic compressors are generally applied to industrial operations where both the volumetric flow rate and pressure ratio requirements are relatively constant."}
{"text": "In general,only the reciprocating compressor allows for reliable flexibility in applying variable volumetric flow rate and variable pressure ratio in an operation.The rotary compressor does not allow for variation in either (except that of pressure through the decompression of the air or gas if the system back pressure is below the design pressure of the machine).The dynamic compressors are designed for specific volumetric flow rates and pressure ratios and are not very useful when these design limits are altered. The positive displacement class of compressors is the most useful group for the oil and gas exploration,drilling and completion and production industry.This section will focus on this class of compressors."}

{"text": "There are other organizations within the United States and regions around the world that have established different standards.The ASME standard atmosphere is at a tempera- ture of 68°F,a pressure of 14.7 psia,and a relative humidity of 36%.The British use a standard atmosphere with a temperature of 60°F and a pressure of 30.00 in.Hg.The Europeans use a standard atmosphere with a temperature of 15℃(59°F)and pressure of750 mmHg(14.5 psia)[3,4]."}
{"text": "When selecting and sizing compressors,care should be taken in determining which standard has been used to rate a compressor under consideration,particularly if the com- pressor has been produced abroad.All further discussions in this section will utilize only the API Mechanical Equipment Standards standard atmosphere."}
{"text": "Compressors are rated as to their maximum input volu- metric flow rate,and their maximum pressure output.These ratings are usually specified as standard cubic feet per minute(scfm)and psig(or standard cubic meters per minute and N/m²gage).The scfm of volumetric flow rate refers to the compressor intake.The pressure rating refers to the output pressure capability."}
{"text": "3.4.3 General Calculations\n\nThere are several important calculations needed to properly evaluate and select the appropriate compressors [1,3,4]."}
{"text": "Flow rate is often given in field units(e.g.,g(cfm))."}
{"text": "These field units are usually converted to consistent units Q(ft³/s)(or in m³/s)."}
{"text": "where T₄is the final temperature the after-cooler is to cool the output(°R)."}
{"text": "Reciprocating compressors are available in both lubri- cated and nonlubricated versions.The lubricated versions provide lubrication for the piston,moving pistons either through an oil lubricated intake air or gas stream,or via an oil pump and injection of oil to the piston sleeve. There are some applications where oil must be completely omitted from the compressed air or gas exiting the machine. For such applications where a reciprocating piston type of compressor is required,there are nonlubricated compres- sors.These compressors have piston rings and wear bands around the periphery of each piston.These wear bands are made of special wear-resistant dry lubricating materials such as polytetrafluorethylene.Trunk type nonlubricated compressors have dry crankcases with permanently lubri- cated bearingsCrosshead type compressors usually have lengthened piston rods to ensure that no oil wet parts enter the compression space [4,5]."}
{"text": "The main disadvantages to multistage reciprocating pis- ton compressors is that they cannot be practically con- structed in machines capable of volumetric flow rates much beyond 1,000 actual cfm.Also,the higher-capacity com- pressors are rather large and bulky and generally require more maintenance than similar capacity rotary compressors."}
{"text": "The most important characteristic of this type of com- pressors is that all havea fixed built-in pressure compression ratio for each stage of compression(as well as a fixed built-in volume displacement)[4].Thus,at a given rate of rotational speed provided by the prime mover,there will be a predetermined volumetric flow rate through the compressor,and the pressure exiting the machine at the outlet will be equal to the design pressure ratio times the inlet pressure."}
{"text": "If the back pressure on the outlet side of the compressor is equal to the fixed output pressure,then there is no expansion of the output gas in the initial portion of the expansion tank or the initial portion of the pipeline."}
{"text": "Nearly all rotary compressors can be designed with multiple stages.Such multistage compressors are designed with nearly equal compression ratios for each stage.Thus, since the volumetric flow rate(in actual cfm)is smaller from one stage to the next,the volume displacement of each stage is progressively smaller."}
{"text": "There is no clearance in a rotary compressor.However, there is leakage of air within the internal seal system and around the vanes.Thus,the typical volumetric efficiency for the sliding vane compression is of the order of 0.82 to 0.90.The heavier the gas,the greater the volumetric efficiency.The higher the pressure ratio through the stage, the lower the volumetric efficiency."}
{"text": "rotary compressors,there are no valves.The gas is sucked into the inlet post and is squeezed between the male and female portion of the rotating intermeshing screw elements and their housing.The compression ratio of the stage and its volumetric flow rate are determined by the geometry of the two rotating screw elements and the speed at which they are rotated."}
{"text": "Screw compressors operate at rather high speeds.Thus, they are rather high volumetric flow rate compressors with relatively small exterior dimensions."}
{"text": "Some screw compressors have been designed to operate with an entirely oil-free compression space.Since the rotat- ing elements of the compressor need not touch each other or the housing,lubrication can be eliminated.However, such rotary screw compressor designs require timing gears. These machines can deliver totally oil-free,water-free dry air(or gas)."}
{"text": "The screw compressor can be staged.Often screw com- pressors are utilized in three-or four-stage versions."}
{"text": "Detailed calculations regarding the design of the rotary screw compressor are beyond the scope of this handbook. Additional details can be found in other references [4-7]."}
{"text": "Volumetric efficiency is determined by the leakage at tips of the lobes.The leakage is referred to as slip.Slippage is a function of rotor diameter,differential pressure,and the gas being compressed."}
{"text": "For details concerning this low pressure compressor see other references [4-7]."}
{"text": "The liquid compressor has rather low efficiency,about 50%.The liquid piston compressor may be staged.The main advantage to this type of compressor is that it can be used to compress gases with significant liquid content in the stream."}
{"text": "The advantages of rotary compressors are low initial capital costs,less bulky construction,and general ease of maintenance.The main disadvantages are an inability to adjust to flow line back pressure (i.e.,fixed compression ratios),the need for frequent specific maintenance for rotat- ing wear surfaces to prevent slippage,and the requirement of most rotary compressors must operate with some oil lubrication in the compression chambers [4,5]."}

{"text": "Drilling and well servicing structures must be designed to safely carry all loads that are likely to be imposed during the structure's life [1].For derricks and masts,the largest vertical dead load that will likely be applied to the structure is the heaviest casing string run into the borehole.The casing string may be floated in by plugging the lower end of the casing;the applied load at the hook is the weight of the casing string in air,reduced by the weight of displaced mud from the casing annulus.For substructures,casing loads can be applied simultaneously with the weight of the drill pipe string racked back on the drill floor."}
{"text": "These loads can be amplified by acceleration and impact while hoisting or setting the casing in the rotary slips.If the casing or drill string becomes stuck in the well bore,it may be necessary to apply an overpull to dislodge the string.For these reasons,it is customary for users to specify a required structural capacity somewhat higher than the maximum expected static drilling loads."}
{"text": "Improper design of foundations or failure to properly interface foundation design with design of the drilling structures is a leading cause of failures of drilling structures due to rig overturning.Freestanding drilling structures used onshore and some offshore structures during skidding are potentially subject to overturning under excessive wind and dynamic conditions.Overturning is also a concern for masts and substructures during erection.The designer must ensure that adequate stability against overturning is provided at all times,and such consideration should include the allowable bearing loading of the foundation.Weights of nonstructural equipment and other items used to stabilize the rig against overturning should be conservatively evaluated;caution should be used in considering weights of items that may be inadvertently left out or that cannot be in place at the time of erection.The rig operating instructions provided by the manufacturer must clearly state the requirements for such items,and the user must refer to and adhere to these instructions."}

Some manufactures use seals the require compression from a gland nut so they can hold pressure.Generally that means any time movement of the hold-down is required,the gland nut must be backed off,releasing any compressing force on the pins.After the pin is moved (in or out)the gland nut must be re-tightened.This potential for tubing movement together with the hold down pins,seals,and gland nut assemblies create opportunities for leaks."}

The MC guide screw will pass thru a gland nut(which can also create a possible leak path).Not all tubing spools will have a MC guide screw."}

{"text": "1.Cable-tool drilling lines.Movement of wire rope against metallic parts can accelerate wear.This can also create sufficient heat to form martensite,causing embrittlement of wire and early wire rope removal.Such also can be formed by friction against the casing or hard rock formation."}
{"text": "2.Rotary drilling lines.Care should be taken to main- tain proper winding of rotary drilling lines on the drawworks drum to avoid excessive friction that may result in the formation of martensite.Martensite may also be formed by excessive friction in won grooves of sheaves,slippage in sheaves,or excessive fric- tion resulting from rubbing against a derrick mem- ber.A line guide should be employed between the drum and the fast line sheave to reduce vibration and to keep the drilling line from rubbing against the derrick."}
{"text": "Martensite is a hard,nonductile microconstituent formed when steel is heated above its critical temperature and cooled rapidly.In the case of steel of the composition conventionally used for rope wire,martensite can be formed if the wire surface is heated to a temperature near or somewhat in excess of 1400°F(760°℃),and then cooled at a comparatively rapid rate.The presence of a martensite film at the surface of the outer wires of a rope that has been in service is evidence that sufficient frictional heat has been generated on the crown of the rope wires to momentarily raise the wire surface temperature to a point above the critical temperature range of the steel.The heated surface is then rapidly cooled by the adjacent cold metal within the wire and the rope structure,and an effective quenching results."}

{"text": "Oil-Base Muds(nonaqueous fluid [NAF])\n\nOil-base muds contain oil(refined from crude such as diesel or synthetic-base oil from natural gas)as the continuous phase and trace amounts of water as the dispersed phase. Oil-base muds generally contain less than 5%(by volume) water(which acts as a polar activator for organophilic clay), whereas invert emulsion fluids generally have more than 5% water in mud.Oil-base muds are usually a mixture of base oil,organophilic clay,and lignite or asphalt,and the filtrate is all oil."}
{"text": "4.5.3.1 Water-Base Muds Testing\n\nTo accurately determine the physical properties of water- based drilling fluids,examination of the fluid is required in a field laboratory setting.In many cases,this consists of a few simple tests conducted by the derrickman or mud Engineer at the rigsite.The procedures for conducting all routine drilling fluid testing can be found in the American Petroleum Institute's APIRP13B-1 and -2[4,5]."}

{"text": "The hardness test sometimes is performed on the whole mud as well as the mud filtrate.The mud hardness indicates the amount of calcium sulphate solids suspended in the mud and the amount of calcium in solution.This test usually is made on gypsum-treated muds to indicate the amount of excess CaSO₄present in suspension.To perform the hardness test on mud,a small sample of mud is first diluted to 50 times its original volume with distilled water so that any undissolved calcium or magnesium compounds can go into solution.The mixture then is filtered through filter paper to obtain a clear filtrate.The total hardness of this filtrate then is obtained using the same procedure used for the filtrate from the low-temperature,low-pressure API filter press apparatus."}

{"text": "Bentonite is added to water-base drilling fluids to increase the viscosity and gel strength of the fluid.This results in quality suspension properties for weight materials and increases the carrying capacity for removal of solids from the well.The most important function of bentonite is to improve the filtration and filter cake properties of the water- base drilling fluid."}
{"text": "Cations are absorbed on the basal surface of the clay crystals to form a natural forming structure.This occurred in the earth over a period of 100 million years.The positive sodium or calcium cations compensate for the atomic substitution in the crystal structure(the isomorphic substitution that took place in forming of the clay).This is the primary way that sodium clays are differentiated from calcium clays."}
{"text": "In solutions with high chloride concentrations,the dou- ble layer is compressed still further,and aggregation occurs. Consequently,the size of the particle is reduced,and the total particle area per unit volume decreases.This occurs because the chloride ion has a strong bond with the H₂O, and free water is not available to enter the clay and hydrate effectively.In muds in which the clay is aggregated,the viscosity is low."}
{"text": "The viscosity rises,and water loss is uncontrollable when the clay flocculates edge to face in a \"House of Cards structure,\"and the increase in viscosity and water loss is dramatic.As the NaCl content increases to 5%,the free water is tied up by the chloride ion,and the ion and the clays collapse and revert to the aggregated state.The water is removed from the clay platelet body."}
{"text": "Lignosulfonate works to deflocculate by the anionic charges that latch onto the positive edges ofthe clay platelet The remainder of this huge (flat)cellulosic molecule is repelled from the negative clay face and rolls out from the edges."}
{"text": "The edge-to-face flocculation that occurred becomes virtually impossible.The polyanionic encapsulator can be rendered neutral if the pH drops below 9.5.The NaCl flocculant is still present in the solution,but its flocculating effects are rendered ineffective if the pH is maintained above 9.5."}
{"text": "Flocculation (Calcium)\n\nWhen calcium is induced into a drilling fluid,its solubility depends on the pH of the water in the fluid.The double- positive charge on the calcium ion will attract itself to the face of the bentonite platelet at an accelerated rate,because this attraction is far superior to the sodium's ability to retain its place on the clay face.The divalent calcium ions will still partially hydrated,but the amount of water is less around the clay platelet.This will allow flocculation to occur much faster,because there is little water structure around the clay in this situation."}
{"text": "Calcium can cause flocculation in the same manner as salt (NaCl)in that edge-to-face groupings are formed. Calcium is a divalent cation,so it holds onto two platelet faces,which causes large groups to form,and then the edge-to-face grouping to take hold.Because calcium(Ca²+) has a valence of 2,it can hold two clay platelets tightly together,and the flocculation reaction starts to happen at very low concentrations.To achieve flocculation with salt (NaC1),it takes 10 times the concentration for the edge-to-face groupings to form."}
{"text": "In the flocculated state,a dispersant (thinner)will work to separate the flocculating ions and encapsulate the platelets by mechanical shear.This is a short-term answer to the problem,however,because the contaminating ion is still active in the system,and it must be reduced to a normal active level for drilling to continue."}
{"text": "Inhibition(NaCl)\n\nWhen a water solution contains more than 12,000 mg/l of NaCl,it can inhibit clays from swelling or hydrating.This happens because the sodium ion content is high in the water, and the sodium ions on the clay face cannot leave to allow space for the water to enter the clay platelet.The chloride ion has an ability to tightly hold onto water molecules, which leaves few free ions to envelope or surround the clay. When the clay(aggregation)platelet does not hydrate,the state is the same as it is in the sack.In this instance,the ion is controlling the swelling of clays and is referred to as inhibition."}
{"text": "Controlling these various clay states in water-base drilling fluids is important for the success of any well using this chemistry.It can be said that flocculation causes and increases viscosity and that aggregation and deflocculation decrease viscosity."}
{"text": "4.5.3.8 WATER-BASE MUDS\n\nA water-base drilling fluid is one that has water as its continuous or liquid phase.The types of drilling fluids are briefly described in the following sections."}
{"text": "Freshwater muds are generally lighly treated or untreated muds having a liquid phase of water,containing small concentrations of salt,and having a pH ranging from 8.0 to 10.5.Freshwater muds include the following types."}
{"text": "Spud Muds\n\nThese muds are prepared with available water and appropri- ate concentrations of bentonite and/or premium commercial clays.They are generally untreated chemically,although lime,cement,or caustic soda is occasionally added to increase viscosity and give the mud a fluff to seal possible lost return zones in unconsolidated upper hole surface formations.Spud muds are used for drilling the surface hole. Their tolerance for drilled solids and contaminants is very limited."}
{"text": "Saturated Salt Muds\n\nSaturated salt water(natural or prepared)is used as makeup water in these fluids.Prehydrated bentonite (hydrated in freshwater)is added to give viscosity,and starch is com- monly used to control fluid loss.Caustic soda is added to adjust the pH,and lignosulfonates are used for gel strength control.Occasionally,soda ash may be used to lower filtrate calcium and adjust the pH.Saturated salt muds are used to drill massive salt sections (composed mainly of NaCl)to prevent washouts and as a work-over or completion fluid. Freshwater bentonite suspensions are converted by adding NaCl to reach saturation.Conversion is carried out by diluting the freshwater mud to reduce the viscosity \"hump\" seen in breakovers.Saturated salt muds usually are used at mud weights below 14.01b/gal."}
{"text": "Calcium Treated Muds\n\nCalcium-treated fluids are prepared from any low or high pH mud by the addition of appropriate amounts of lime or gypsum,caustic soda,and thinner (lignite or lignosul- fonate).Calcium-treated muds include lime and gypsum muds."}
{"text": "Lime Muds\n\nLime muds include low-and high-lime muds.They are prepared from available muds by adding calcium lignosul- fonate,lignite,caustic soda or KOH,lime,and a filtration- control material,PAC or starch.Caustic soda is used to maintain the filtrate alkalinity(Pf values)and lime to control the mud alkalinity(Pm values)and excess lime.Lime muds offer resistance to salt,cement,or anhydrite contamination even at high mud weights."}
{"text": "Gypsum Mud\n\nCommonly called \"gyp muds,\"they are prepared from freshwater and conditioned with bentonite or from available gel and water mud.Caustic soda is added for pH control. Gypsum,lignosulfonate,and additional caustic soda are added simultaneously to the mud.CMC may be added for filtration control.This fluid is used for drilling in mildly reactive shale or where gypsum or anhydrite must be drilled. It resists contamination from cement or salt.Use is limited by the temperature stability of the filtration control materi- als,CMC(250°F±)."}
{"text": "4.5.3.9 Special Muds\n\nIn addition to the most common mud systems discussed previously,there are other muds that do not fall neatly into one category or another in the classification scheme."}
{"text": "This system involves injecting air or gas downhole at the rates sufficient to attain annular velocity of 2,000 to 3,000 f/min.Hard formations that are relatively free from water are most desirable for drilling with air-gas drilling fluids.Small quantities of water usually can be dried up or sealed off by various techniques [6]."}
{"text": "Air-gas drilling usually increases drilling rate by three or four times over that when drilling with mud,as well as one-half to one-fourth the number of bits are required.In some areas,drilling with air is the only solution;these are (1)severe lost circulation,(2)sensitive producing formation that can be blocked by drilling fluid(skin effect),and (3) hard formations near the surface that require the use of an air hammer to drill."}
{"text": "There are two major limitations with using air as a drilling fluid:large volumes of free water and size of the hole.Large water flows generally necessitate converting to another type of drilling fluid(mist or foam).Size of the hole determines a volume of air required for good cleaning.Lift ability of air depends annular velocity entirely(no viscosity or gel strength).Therefore,large holes require an enormous volume of air,which is not economical."}
{"text": "[Tolerates large water influx."}
{"text": "Nondispersed (Low-Solids)Muds\n\nThe term low-solids mud covers a wide variety of mud types,including clear water(fresh,salt,or brine), oil-in-water emulsions,and polymer or biopolymer fluids (muds with polymer and no other additives)."}
{"text": "Extended Bentonite Muds\n\nLow-solids nondispersed mud is generally prepared from freshwater with little or no drilled solids and bentonite, along with a dual-action polymer for extending the ben- tonite and flocculating drilled solids.This type of mud is designed for low-solids content and to have low viscosity at the bit for for high drilling rates.The polymers used greatly increases the viscosity contributed by the bentonite and serve as flocculants for native clay solids,making them easier to remove by solids-control equipment.These polymers or bentonite extenders permit the desired viscosity to be maintained with about half of the amount of bentonite normally required.No deflocculant is used,so a flocculated system is maintained.The flocculation and lower solids content permit the mud to have a relatively low viscosity at the bit and at the bottom of the hole,where shear rates are high,and a relatively high viscosicy at the lower shear rates in the annulus for good hole cleaning.One problem with this type of fluid is that filtration rates are fairly high, because the solids are flocculated and their quantity is low. This means that they do not pack tightly in the flter cake. Sodium polyacrylates or small amounts of CMC may be added for filtration control."}
{"text": "The temperature limitation of extended bentonite fluids is 200-275°F.Other benefits include improved hydraulics and less wear on bits and pump parts."}
{"text": "The surfactant mud usually encountered is a lignite sur- factant mud system.This mud is made up from freshwater using bentonite,lignite,and the surfactant.Small amounts of defoamer may be required with the addition of the lignite. The pH of this mud is maintained within closely fixed limited(8.5-10.0)for maximum solubility of the thinner (lignite).Tolerance to salt,gyp,and cement contamination is limited.To retain satisfactory flow properties at high temperatures,the clay content of the mud must be kept low (1-1.6 CEC capacity)through the use of dilution and solids- control equipment.The combination of lignite with surfac- tant in this mud enables its use at extremely high bottom- hole temperatures.This is due to the temperature stability of lignite and the effect of the surfactant in providing viscosity control and minimizing gel strength development at higher temperatures."}
{"text": "High-Temperature Polymer Muds\n\nDevelopment of a high-temperature polymer system evolved from a need for a mud system with low solids and nondispersive performance at higher temperatures."}
{"text": "The polymeric deflocculant is a low-molecular-weight, modified polyacrylate deflocculant used to reduce rheologi- cal properties of the system.If differs from lignosulfonates in that it does not require caustic soda or an alkaline environ- ment to perform.Limited amounts of the polymer may be used in low-mud-weight systems,but larger additions will be needed at higher mud weights and when adding barite to increase the fluid density."}
{"text": "The backbone of the system is an acrylamide copolymer used to control fluid loss.In freshwater systems,1 to 21b/bb will be the range required to control the API fluid loss.In seawater systems,the concentration will range from 4 to 5lb/bbl.HPHT fluid loss can also be controlled with the polymer.It is not affected by salinity or moderate levels of calcium.At higher concentrations of contaminants,some increase in viscosity will result."}
{"text": "Caustic soda and/or potassium hydroxide are alkaline agents used to control the pH of the system.Either is used to maintain the system pH between 8.3 and 9.0."}
{"text": "Oxygen scavengers serve two purposes in this system."}
{"text": "First,because of the low pH characteristic of the system, it should be added to protect the drill pipe.(Run corro- sion rings in the drill pipe to determine treatment rates for the corrosion that may be occurring.)Second,as the temperature of the mud exceeds 300°F,any oxygen present will react with the polymers and reduce their efficiency. Additional treatment will be required to replace affected or degraded polymers."}
{"text": "Oil-Base Mud Systems and Nonaqueous Fluids(NAF) Oil-base muds are composed of oil as the continuous phase, water as the dispersed phase,emulsifiers,wetting agents, and gellants.Other chemicals are used for oil-base mud treatment,such as degellants,filtrate reducers,and weight- ing agents."}
{"text": "The external phase of oil-base mud is oil and does not allow the water to contact the formation;the shales are thereby prevented from becoming wet with water and dispersing into the mud or caving into the hole."}
{"text": "The stability of an emuslion mud is an important factor that has to be closely monitored while drilling.Poor sta- bility results in coalescence of the dispersed phase,and the emulsion will separate into two distinct layers.Presence of any water in the HPHT filtrate is an indication of emulsion instability."}
{"text": "Properly designed water-phase salinity invert fluids will pull water from the shale (through osmosis),which hardens the shale and stabilizes it for long-term integrity."}
{"text": "Generally,oil-base mud is to delivered to the rig mixed to the desired specifications.In some cases,the oil-base mud can be mixed on location,but this process can cost expen- sive rig time.In the latter case,the mostimportant principles are(1)to ensure that ample energy in the form of shear is applied to the fluid and(2)to strictly follow a prescribed order of mixing.The following mixing procedure is usually recommended:\n\n1.Pump the required amount of oil into the tank."}
{"text": "2.Add the calculated amounts of emulsifiers and wetting agent.Stir,agitate,and shear these components until adequate dispersion is obtained."}

{"text": "● Wiper rubber—to keep the surface of the pipe dry and save mud."}
{"text": "C. Low-gravity solids contents of oil-base muds should be kept at less than 6%v/v.Although oil muds are more tolerant for solids contamination,care must be taken to ensure that solids loading does not exceed the recommended guidelines.A daily log of solids content enables the engineer to quickly determine a solids level at which the mud system performs properly."}
{"text": "D. Water-wet solids is a very serious problem;in severe cases,uncontrollable barite setting may result.If there are any positive signs of water-wet solids,a wetting agent should be added immediately.Tests for water-wet solids should be run daily."}
{"text": "E. Temperature stability and emulsion stability depend on the proper alkalinity maintenance and emulsifier concentration.If the concentration of lime is too low, the solubility of the emulsifier changes,and the emul- sion loses its stability.Lime maintenance has to be established and controlled by alkalinity testing.The recommended range of lime content for oil-base muds is\n\n0.1 to 41b/bbl,depending on base oil being used.Some of the newer ester-base muds have a low tolerance for hydroxyl ions;in this case,lime additions should be closely controlled."}
{"text": "F. CaCl₂content should be checked daily to ensure the desired levels of inhibition are maintained."}
{"text": "G. The oil-to-water ratio influences funnel viscosity,plas- tic viscosity,and HTHP filtration of the oil-base mud Retort analysis is used to detect any change in the oil- water ratio,because changes to the oil-water ration can indicate an intrusion of water."}
{"text": "H. Electrical Stability is a measure of how well the water is emulsified in the continuous oil phase.Because many factors affect the electrical stability of oil-base muds, the test does not necessarily indicate that a particular oil-base muds,the test does not necessarily indicate that a particular oil-base mud is in good or in poor condition. For this reason,values are relative to the system for which they are being recorded.Stability measurement should be made routinely and the values recorded and plotted so that trends may be noted.Any change in electrical stability indicates a change in the system."}
{"text": "1.HTHP filtration should exhibit a low filtrate volume (<6ml).The filtrate should be water free;water in the filtrate indicates a poor emulsion,probably caused by water wetting of solids."}
{"text": "4.5.3.10 Environmental Aspects of Drilling Fluids\n\nMuch attention has been given to the environmental aspects of the drilling operation and the drilling fluid components. Well-deserved concern about the possibility of polluting underground water supplies and of damaging marine organ- isms,as well as effects on soil productivity and surface water quality,has stimulated widespread studies on this subject."}
{"text": "Drilling Fluid Toxicity\n\nThere are three contributing mechanisms of toxicity in drilling fluids:chemistry of mud mixing and treatment, storage and disposal practices,and drilled rock.The first group conventionally has been known the best because it includes products deliberately added to the system to build and maintain the rheology and stability of drilling fluids."}
{"text": "Petroleum,whether crude or refined products,should not be added to water-base muds.Adequate substitutes exist and are economically viable for most situations.Levels of 1%or more of crude oil may be present in drilled rock cuttings,some of which will be in the mud."}
{"text": "Heavy metals are present in drilled formation solids and in naturally occurring materials used as mud additives.The latter include barite,bentonite,lignite,and mica(sometimes used to control mud lossess downhole).There are back- ground levels of heavy metals in trees that carry through into lignosulfonate made from them."}
{"text": "Attention has focused on heavy metal impurities found in sources of barite.Proposed U.S.regulations would exclude many sources of barite ore based on levels of con- tamination.European and other countries are contemplating regulations of their own."}
{"text": "Chromium lignosulfonates are the biggest contributions to heavy metals in drilling fluids.Although studies have shown minimal environmental impact,substitutes exist that can result in lower chromium levels in muds.The less- used chromium lignites(trivalent chromium complexes)are similar in character and performance,with less chormium."}
{"text": "Zinc compounds such as zinc oxide and basic zinc carbonate are used in some drilling fluids.Their function is to react out swiftly sulfide and bisulfide ions originat- ing with hydrogen sulfide in drilled formations.Because human safety is at stake,there can be no compromising effectiveness,and substitutes for zinc have not seemed to be effective.Fortunately,most drilling situations do not require the addition of sulfide scavengers."}
{"text": "The third source of toxicity in drilling discharges are the cuttings from drilled rocks.A study of 36 cores col- lected from three areas(Gulf of Mexico,California,and Oklahoma)at various drilling depths (300 to 18,000 ft) revealed that the total concentration of cadmium in drilled rocks was more than five times greater than the cadmium concentration in commercial barites.It was also estimated, using a 10,000-ft model well discharge volumes,that 74.9% of all cadmium in drilling waste may be contributed by cuttings,but only 25.1%originate from the barite and the pipe dope."}
{"text": "Summary of Flashpoint and Aromatic Data\n\nWith the introduction of synthetic-base muds into the mar- ket,the EPA moved to provide guidelines on the quality and quantity of the synthetic oils being discharged into the Gulf of Mexico.In addition to the water column aquatic testing done for water-base fluids,the EPA set forth guidelines for examining toxicity to organisms living in the sediments of the seafloor.A Leptocheirus sedimentary reworker test was instituted in February of 2002 for all wells being drilled with synthetic-base muds to examine how oil-coated cuttings being discharged into the Gulf of Mexico would impact the organisms living on the seafloor."}
{"text": "When a well is drilled with a synthetic-base mud, monthly and end-of-well tests are required for the Mysid and Leptocheirus,organisms to ensure that the synthetic- base oil being used meets a certain standard of environmen- tal performance.There are two standards that can be used for these annual and well-to-well tests:an ester standard and a C16-C18 Internal Olefin standard."}

{"text": "Workover fluids are fluids used during the reworking of a well after its initial completion.They may be gases such as nitrogen or natural gas,brine waters,or muds. Workover fluids are used during operations such as well killing,cleaning out a well,drilling into a new production interval,and plugging back to complete a shallower interval."}
{"text": "Completion fluids are used during the process of estab- lishing final contact between the productive formation and the wellbore.They may be a water-base mud,nitrogen,oil mud,solids-free brine,or acid-soluble system.The most significant requirement is that the fluid does not damage the producing formation and does not impair production performance."}

{"text": "Potassium chloride(KCl)brines are excellent comple- tion fluids for water-sensitive formations when densities over(9.7ppg)(1.16 SG)are not required.Corrosion rates are reasonably low and can be reduced even more by keeping the pH of the system between 7 and 10 and using corrosion inhibitors(1%by volume).Sodium chloride is one of the most used single-salt brines.Advantages of sodium chloride brines are low cost and wide availability.Densities up to 10.0ppg are achievable for this single-salt brine.Calcium chloride (CaCl₂)brines are easily mxied at densities up to 11.6ppg(1.39 SG).Sodium bromide brines can be used when the density of a calcium chloride brine is desired, but the presence of acid gas is possible.Sodium bromide has low corrosion rates even without the use of corrosion inhibitors.Although these brines are more expensive than CaCl₂brines,they are useful in CO₂environments."}
{"text": "There is not much of a crystallization problem with cal- cium chloride/calcium bromide brines at densities between 11.7 and 13.5 ppg(1.40 and 1.62SG).However,the heavier CaCl₂/CaBr2 brines require special formulation in cold weather applications."}
{"text": "4.5.4.4 Three-Salt Brines\n\nThree-salt brines such as calcium chloride/calcium bro- mide/zinc bromide brines are composed of CaCl₂,CaBr₂, and ZnBr₂.At high temperatures,corrosion reates in brines containing ZnBr2 are very high and can result in severe damage to equipment.For use at high temperatures,the brine should be treated with corrosion inhibitors.The cor- rosion rate of the treated brine is usually less than 3 mm per year."}
{"text": "Viscosity\n\nIn many cases,the viscosity of the fluid must be increased to provide lifting capacity required to bring sand or cuttings to the surface at reasonable circulating rates.A popular viscosifier for completion and workover fluids is hydroxy- ethylcellulose (HEC).It is a highly refined,partially water soluble,and acid-soluble polymer with very little residue when acidized.Other materials used as viscosifiers include guar gums and biogums(xanthan).Although these materials are applicable in certain instances,they do not meet the acid or water-solubility standards of HEC.HECis the most common viscosifier for all types of brines."}
{"text": "In some cases,solids must be suspended at low shear or static conditions.Available alternatives include clays and polymers.The most widely used suspension agent in completion and workover fluids is xanthan gum."}
{"text": "Suspension or Filtration Control:Filtration\n\nIn most applications,some measure of filtration control is desirable.The standard approach to filtration control in completion and workover fluids is the use of property sized calcium carbonate particles for bridging in conjunction with colloidal size materials such as starch or CMC.The reason for the popularity of calcium carbonate is that it is acid soluble and can be removed.In some cases,oil-soluble resins are used as bridging agents,as are sized salts when used in saturated salt brines."}
{"text": "Special brine formulations are used to accommodate seasonal changes in temperature.Summer blends are fluids appropriate for use in warmer weather.Their crystallization points range from approximately 7-20℃2(45°F-68°F). Winter blends are used in colder weather or colder climates and have crystallization points ranging from approximately 20°F(-6℃)to below 0°F(-18℃).At times,a crystal- lization point between those of summer and winter blends is desirable.Special formulations are then used to prepare fluids that can be called fall,spring,or intermediate blends\n\nAt first,it may seem practical to consistently formulate fluids having lower than necessary,and therefore safe,crys- tallization points.Although this approach may be easier,it is likely to be much more expensive.Generally,the lower the crystallization point,the more the fluid costs.If you provide a fluid having a crystallization point much lower than necessary,you are likely to be providing a fluid with a considerably higher cost than necessary.This is just one of numerous factors to consider when selecting a fluid that is both effective and economical."}

{"text": "Filtration has evolved from the surface filtering systems with low-flow volumes to highly sophisticated systems. Regardless of which system is used,a case for filtering fluid can be made for every well completed,every workover,and every secondary recovery project."}
{"text": "The purpose of filtering any fluid is to prevent the downhole contamination of the formation with undesirable solids present in the completion fluid.Contamination can impact production and shorten the productive life of the well.Contamination can occur during perforating,fractur- ing,acidizing,workover,water flooding,and gravel packing of a well.Any time a fluid containing solids is put into the wellbore,a chance of damaging the well exists."}
{"text": "Contaminants in fluids come in many sizes and forms."}
{"text": "Cuttings from drilling operations,drilling mud,rust,scale, pipe dope,paraffin,undissolved polymer,and any other material on the casing or tubing string contributes to the solids in the fluid.At times,it is virtually impossible, because of particle size,to remove all of the solids from the fluid,but by filtering,the chance of success can be increased almost to 100%."}
{"text": "In summary,successful completions primarily depend on following a set procedure without taking shortcuts and on good housekeeping practices.A key elementin the entire process is using clean fluids,which is made possible in large part through filtration techniques."}
{"text": "4.5.6.2 Cartridge Filters\n\nEach field,formation and well site has unique character- istics and conditions.These include reservoir rock perme- abilities,pore sizes,connate fluid composition,downhole pressures,and so on.These conditions dictate the brine composition and level of clarity needed for a proper com- pletion,which determine the level of filtration needed to achieve the fluid clarity level required."}
{"text": "The cartridge is made of a perforated metal or plastic tube,layered with permeable material or wrapped with fil- ament to form a permeable matrix around the tube.Coarser particles are stopped at or near the surface of the filter,and the finer particles are trapped within the matrix.Pleated outer surfaces are used to provide larger surface areas.Car- tridge filters are rated by pore sizes such as 1,2,4,10,25, and 50μm,which relate to the size of particles that the filter can remove.This rating is nominal or absolute,depending on how the cartridges are constructed.A nominally rated filter can be expected to remove approximately 90%of the particles that are larger than its nominal rating.Actually, solids larger than the rating pass through these filters,but the concentration of the larger particles is reduced.High flow rates and pressures cause their efficiencies to fall.They must be constantly monitored and changed when they begin to plug,or the fluid will begin to bypass the filters."}
{"text": "Absolute rated filters achieve a sharp cutoff at its rated size.They should remove all the particles larger than their rating and generally become plugged much faster than nominally rated cartridges.Cartridge filters are most often used downstream of other filters for final clarification."}
{"text": "4.5.6.3 Tubular Filters\n\nTubular filters consist of a fabric screen surrounding a perfo- rated stainless steel tube.Dirty fluid flows from the outside, through the fabric,where solids are stopped,and the filtrate passes into the center tube.The fabric can remove particles down to 1 to 3 μm.Because the solids are trapped on the outside surface of fabric,the element is easy to backwash and clean.Backwashing is accomplished by changing the valving and forcing clean brine back through the filter in the opposite direction.In 8-15 seconds,the element can be filtering again."}

{"text": "Prior to the creation of the API in 1919,early petroleum operators used cable tool rigs to drill the majority of oil and gas wells in the Ohio,Pennsylvania and West Virginia areas in the late 1800s and into the early 1900s.These were usually shallow wells at around 2000 ft in depth or less. These cable tool rigs were also used in the early 1900s for the initial oil and gas exploration and production successes in the East Texas and Western Louisiana areas where the well depths were near 3000 ft."}
{"text": "The new rotary drilling technology was invented by the French in the late 1880s as a water well drilling technology. This technology was introduced into oil and gas drilling operations in the USA in 1901,but this newer method of drilling was not in general use in the US oil and gas sedimentary basins until the 1920s.At that time nearly all of the oil and gas wells that had been drilled in the USA had been drilled using cable tool rigs.Rotary drill rigs starting their domination of oil and gas well drilling in the 1940s and from then on this new drilling technology became the technology of choice into the present day [1,2]."}
{"text": "to supply fresh water to remote populations.The cable tool technology uses a short section of rigid solid steel bar(about 20-30 ft in length)with a pointed chisel like bit configuration on its bottom end which breaks up the formation rock when this unique tool is dropped repeatedly on the bottom the borehole.This cable tool rigid bar bit is called the“drill stem”and is hung at the bottom end of the long drilling line cable which is suspended from one end of the spudding(or walking)beam of the cable tool rig.The spudding beam is operated by the bullwheel on the cable tool rig floor [3].As the bullwheel is turned the spudding beam pivots and allows the end with the drilling line cable attached to move up and down and make repeated drops of the drill stem bit to break up the rock forma- tion at the bottom of the hole and advance the borehole depth."}
{"text": "Drill collars are classified according to the shape of their cross section as round(i.e.,conventional drill collars),spiral drillcollars(i.e.,spiral groves machined in the collar outer surfaces),and square drill collars.Spiral drill collars are used for drilling formations in which the threat of downhole fluids differential pressure that can cause the drill collar smooth surface to be stuck to the exposed rock formation (e.g.,\"differential sticking\").The spiral grooves in the spiral collar outer surface thwarts the differential sticking threat during drilling operations.The square drill collar is used to increase the stiffness of the BHA which in turn allows the drilling operation to drill straighter vertical wells."}
{"text": "Specialized downhole tools like those given in the list above that are often included in most modern BHAs will use similar alloy steels for housings and other structural components are the same as those discussed above for drill collars [8,9]."}
{"text": "Range I tubulars for the fabrication of drill collars and drill pipe are designated for use by small land drilling rigs that are typically used for water well,environmental,and geotechnical drilling projects.Some oil and gas service companies also use these smaller drilling rigs with Range 1 drill collars and drill pipe for shallow maintenance opera- tions."}
{"text": "Range 3 tubulars are designated for the fabrication of drill collars and drill pipe are designated for nearly exclusive use by offshore drilling rigs.The Range 3 drill collars and drill pipe are particularly important to these very expensive drilling operations since these larger offshore drilling rigs are capable of pulling three Range 3drill collars or drill pipe joints.This capability of pulling triple allows these offshore drilling operations to be far more efficient in making trips into and out of the well."}
{"text": "4.6.2.4 Bending Stress Ratio\n\nThe mechanical failure of nearly all drill collars most typically occurs in one of the last thread root in the pin of a drill collar connection.This is due to the weakness of the a typical drill collar connection relative to the remainder of the drill collar itself when subjected to bending stresses which occur when the drill string(BHA)is passed through a directional radius turn or through a borehole dogleg.This connection pin weakness can be quantified with the bending stress ratio(BSR).The BSR is a very useful design tool that can be employed to assist in the design the BHA(and later on in this section in designing some limited other connections within the remainder of the drill string)."}

The unique innovations in these new drill pipe designs were shouldered tool joint connections that are friction welded to opposite ends of a tube body (i.e.,denoted as“drill pipe tube body\").The standard drill pipe today as in the past are designed to be in tension only.The drill collars are the only major components in the drill string that are placed in compression to provide weight on the bit."}
{"text": "Most tool joints are made from materials similar to AISI 4240 steel forgings,tubing,or bars.All tool joints are heat treated to the same material yield strength of approximately 120,00 psi,regardless of the intended API drill pipe grade (tube body)classification of the final product."}

{"text": "These are progressively higher steel minimum yield strength grades which will,in turn,would require progres- sively stronger tool joints in order to ensure that the weak link in each drill pipe design remains the drill pipe tube body and not the tooljoints.Since the great majority of tool joints are fabricated from steel with minimum yield strength of 120,00 psi,this will require progressively more steel volume in the tooljoints(usually via increased ODs).Therefore,itis assumed that this relationship is reflected in the range values and can estimate the allocation of this increase in adjusted unit weight values between the six grades of steel."}

{"text": "Environmental factors such as the nature of the forma- tion to be drilled,hole depth and direction,characteristics of drilling fluids,and the way in which a drill rig is operated are also of critical importance to bit performance and design.Engineers consider these factors for all designs, and every design begins with close cooperation between the designer and the drilling company to ensure all applicable inputs contribute to the bit's design."}
{"text": "Bentson Bit Design Method\n\nThe bit geometry and cutting structure engineering method of H.G.Bentson,reported in his paper entitled\"Roller Cone Bit Design,\"has since 1956 been the root from which most roller cone bit design methods have been based [1]. Although modern engineering techniques and tools have advanced dramatically from those used in 1956,Benson's method is still the basis from which the design process has been derived.It continues to be useful as a background explanation of elements of bit design and is outlined later."}
{"text": "Most geometric and mechanical features of a bit are tied to the bit's circular cross-section.For example,the size of journals,bearings,cones,and hydraulic and lubrication features are collectively governed by circular cross-section. Individually,the sizing of the various elements can,to an extent,be varied.An increase in the physical size of one element will necessitate a corresponding decrease in one or more of the others,however.Proportions between component parts such as a cone and a bearing are a compromise between bearing dimensions,in which larger usually has advantages,and cone shell thickness,in which increased thickness is,again,generally advantageous.The design of the final assembly of mating journals,bearings, and cones involves an even more complex array ofcompro- mises.Repositioning or altering size or shape of a single component nearly always requires subsequent additional changes in one or more of the other features.In smaller bits, finding good compromises can be difficult because of their shortage of available space."}
{"text": "Cone Offset Angle\n\nTo increase the skidding-gouging action,bit designers gen- erate additional working force by skewing(or offsetting)the centerlines of the cones so they do not intersect at a common point on the bit.The angle of skew is called the cone offset angle.Cone offset forces a cone to turn within the limits of the hole,rather than on its own axis."}
{"text": "Cone offset angle is the horizontal distance between the axis of a bit and the vertical plane through the axis of its journal.Offset is a dimension measured from the journal centerline to the bit centerline.The line segment representing the amount of offset is perpendicular to both journal and bit centerlines.Offset is established by moving the centerline of a cone away from the centerline of the bit in such a way that a vertical plane through the cone centerline is parallel to the vertical centerline of the bit."}
{"text": "Basic cone geometry is directly affected by increasing or decreasing either the journal angle or the offset angle and a change in one of the two requires a compensating change in the other.For example,an increase in the journal angle requires an offsetting decrease in the cone offset angle."}
{"text": "Skidding-gouging improves penetration in soft and medium formations at the expense of increased insert or tooth wear.Bit designers limit the use of offset soresults just meet requirements for formation penetration.In abrasive formations,offset can reduce cutting structure service life to an impractical level.As a result,bits designed for abra- sive applications typically use small offsets that minimize skidding-gouging action."}
{"text": "In general,the physical appearance of cutting structures designed for soft,medium,and hard formations can be readily recognized by the length and geometric arrangement of their inserts."}
{"text": "Insert or tooth clearances relative to adjacent cones must be closely controlled.Within limits,these clearances are maintained to the smallest possible dimension to gain maximum use of space.Excessive clearance results in inadequate bottom-hole coverage and accelerated wear on inserts or teeth.Excessive dimensions sacrifice insert or tooth depth,cone-shell thickness,and permissible bearing size.Insufficient clearance can cause interference between adjacent cones."}
{"text": "The composite view of the cones shown later the cone cluster is required to determine the bottom-hole coverage. This layout presents an overall check on the general insert or tooth spacing and is required for proper engineering of insert or tooth balance and insert or tooth arrangement. Spaces representing uncut bottom are kept to a minimum and,within limits,are balanced.If these spaces are kept uniform and within the dimensional limits shown,teeth on an offset bit will wipe away any uncut bottom."}
{"text": "Length-to-diameter ratios of bearing rollers must fal within engineered limits.Rollers that do not have proper proportions tend to skew in their race or fail from beam loading.Roller and ball race flange thicknesses must be adequate to eliminate failure under the severest condi- tions.Balance between these elements must be maintained to prevent excessive wear or premature failure by one of them."}
{"text": "Relationships of Bearing Size,Insert or Teeth Dimensions,and Cone Shell\n\nCone insert or tooth length(the two are not exactly the same but have the same effect)affects bearing-structure size. Insert length describes the required shell thickness value for the drilled hole in which an insert is supported.Within the confine of available space,longer teeth are achieved by reducing cone shell thickness."}
{"text": "Formation and cuttings removal impact cutting structure design.Soft,low compressive strength formations require long,sharp,and widely spaced inserts or teeth.Penetration rate in this type of formation is partially a function of insert or tooth length and maximum insert or tooth depth must be used.Limits on the magnitude of maximum insert or tooth length are dictated by minimum requirements for cone-shell thickness and for bearing-structure size.Insert or tooth spacing must be sufficiently large to ensure efficient cleaning and cutting removal."}
{"text": "In softer and,to some extent,medium hardness forma- tions,formation characteristics are such that provisions for efficient cleaning require careful attention from designers If cutting structure geometry does not promote cuttings removal,bit penetration will be impeded and force the rate of penetration to decrease.Conversely,successful cutting structure engineering encourages both cone shell cleaning and cuttings removal."}
{"text": "Variations in downhole conditions and operating limi- tations often require use of different bit types even though drillability of the formations may be similar.Crooked-hole problems,for example,generally necessitate use of reduced WOB and higher rotary speeds.A different bit type may be required from that for the same formation under conditions that permit heavier weight and lower rotary speed.Weight on bit or rotary-speed limitations imposed by other factors would have a similar effect on the bit-type requirements Knowledge of these design factors and their application to specific bit types is important to making productive bit choices."}

{"text": "4.7.1.1.5 Inserts and Wear-Resistant Hardfacing Materials\n\nTungsten carbide is one of the hardest materials known to man.This hardness makes it extremely useful as a cutting and abrasion resisting material for roller cone bits.The compressive strength of tungsten carbide is much greater than its tensile strength.It is a material whose usefulness is to be gained only within design arrangement that ensure compressive loading while protecting against shear and ten- sion.Tungsten carbide bearing inserts are the most popular material for drill bit cutting elements.Hardfacing materials containing tungsten carbide grains are the standard for protection against abrasive wear on bit surfaces."}
{"text": "When most say \"tungsten carbide,\"they do not refer to the chemical compound (WC),but rather to a sintered composite of tungsten carbide grains imbedded in and metallurgically bonded to a ductile matrix,or binder phase. Such materials are included in a family of materials called cermets or ceramic-metal.Binders support tungsten carbide grains and provide tensile strength.Because of binder, cutters can be formed into useful shapes that orient tungsten carbide grains so they will be loaded under compression. Tungsten carbide cermets can also be polished to a very smooth finish that reduces sliding friction.By control of grain size and binder content,the hardness and strength of these materials can be tailored to yield optimal properties for individual applications."}
{"text": "Dual-Composite(DC)Tungsten Carbide Inserts\n\nDC tungsten carbide is a new class of carbide that improves fracture toughness limitations associated with conventional tungsten carbide grades.The material is characterized by large tungsten carbide particles that are manufactured in a multi-stage process and by a microstructure that is more homogeneous than conventional cemented tungsten car- bides.DC tungsten carbide increases fracture toughness by as much as 50%over tough,cemented tungsten carbide grades without affecting wear performance and,in some cases,have improved both toughness and wear resistance."}
{"text": "When designing diamond-enhanced inserts,incorpora- tion of higher diamond densities increases impact resis- tance and ability to economically penetrate abrasive forma- tions.As would be expected,increasing diamond density increases insert cost.In the past,diamond-enhanced inserts have been available only in symmetric shapes.The first of these was the semi-round top insert.Today,some manu- facturers have developed processes that make it possible to produce complex,diamond-enhanced insert shapes."}

{"text": "A particular advantage of cellular diamond material is that its geometry and structure can be engineered and scaled for particular applications.For example,complex insert shapes that previously could not have been diamond enhanced now are protected by cellular diamond [6]."}
{"text": "melting with the bit feature being hardfaced.In the process, tungsten carbide grains flow as a solid,with melted steel from the rod,onto the bit.The steel solidifies around the tungsten carbide particles,firmly attaching them to the bit."}
{"text": "Tungsten Carbide Insert Design\n\nThe design of tungsten carbide inserts takes the proper- ties of both tungsten carbide materials and the geometric efficiency for drilling of a particular rock formation into account.Softer materials require geometries that are long and sharp to encourage rapid penetration.Impact loads are low but abrasive wear can be high.Hard materials are drilled more by a crushing and grinding action than by penetration.Impact loads and abrasion can be very high.Tough materials,such as carbonates,are drilled by a gouging action and can sustain high impact loads and high operating temperatures.Variations in the way that drilling is accomplished,and rock formation properties govern the shape and grade of the correct tungsten carbide inserts to be selected."}
{"text": "employ tungsten carbide or diamond-enhanced inserts on the gage.Under abrasive conditions,severe wear or gage- rounding is common,and at high rotary speeds,the gage row can experience temperatures that lead to heat checking, chipping,and eventually breakage."}
{"text": "Special Cutting Structure Features\n\nSpecial cutting features include heel row cutters and ridge cutter inserts."}
{"text": "the cutting structure,cuttings removal from the hole bottom and efficient cuttings evacuation.The hydraulic energy that causes fluid circulation is one of only three variable energy inputs(WOB,rotary speed,and hydraulic flow),available on a drill rig for optimization of drilling performance."}
{"text": "Many roller cone bit options such as nozzle selection, flow tubes,vectored flow tubes,and center nozzle ports help optimize hydraulic performance.These hydraulic features give alternatives to drilling operators for precise placement of hydraulic energy according to needs at the well bottom."}
{"text": "Generating cuttings is the first step needed to achieve high penetration rates;cleaning cuttings from the cone and from the hole bottom and lifting them through the annulus to the rig reserve pit is the remaining part of a hydraulic solu- tion.Computer modeling supported by laboratory testing is the most common approach to development and verifica- tion of hydraulic designs.Efficient velocity profiles deliver hydraulic energy where it is most needed,particularly in cases in which drilling flow rates are compromised."}
{"text": "cones.This minimizes cuttings regrind and improves rates of penetration.Extended nozzles are particularly useful in marginal hydraulic environments and high overbalance applications."}
{"text": "For maximum benefit of a diverged center flow,approx- imately 20%of total hydraulic flow should be programmed through the center jet;10%or less is generally too little to be effective while 30%or more erodes the cone area excessively."}
{"text": "Center Nozzles\n\nCenter nozzles are installed on the vertical centerline of a bit to provide a discharge onto the apex area of the three roller cones and enhance cone cleaning.Center nozzles are typically standard equipment on bit larger than 16 in."}
{"text": "Blank Nozzles\n\nA plug that is used to close or block a fluid discharge port on a roller cone bit.Blank nozzles are threaded and can be field installed.They are typically used to create cross-flow configurations in bit nozzling."}
{"text": "Asymmetric Nozzle Configurations and Cross-flow\n\nA bit has a symmetric nozzle configuration when three nozzles,at the same level on the periphery of a bit,of the same size and type are installed 120°to each other.A bit with an asymmetric nozzle configuration has at least two different nozzle sizes or types installed around the periphery of the bit."}
{"text": "nozzle configuration,the dead zones move away from the impingement zone of the larger jet and toward that of the smaller jet.This has the benefit of moving a stagnation zone away from the middle of the cone.Asymmetric flows ensure that cuttings do not become impounded under a bit causing the inefficiencies of regrind,lower rates of penetration,and erosion wear to the bit."}
{"text": "Bit hydraulic energy is the energy needed to counteract frictional energy (loss)at the bit,or can be expressed as the energy expended at the bit."}
{"text": "See prior equation for metric conversion."}
{"text": "2.Use asymmetric nozzle configurations."}
{"text": "4.Re-evaluate and optimize hydraulics as applications and\n\n5.Design the hydraulic program to address requrements of key lithologies in the bit run."}
{"text": "6.Run center jets in sediments that have bitballing tendencies."}
{"text": "7.Use diffusing center-jets to minimize cone erosion and fluid wash."}
{"text": "Primary bearings,the main load-bearing component,are normally as large as possible within the limits of available space.Secondary bearings are smaller,reduced diameter, bearings located adjacent to the apex area of a cone.Sec- ondary bearings provide additional load-bearing capability in an area too small in diameter for the primary bearings Primary and secondary bearings can be roller bearings or journal bearings.It is common for a bearing system to be composed of combinations of the two,such as a primary roller bearing and secondary journal bearing."}
{"text": "Seals prevent the entrance of cuttings and drilling fluids into the bearing system and prevent lubricant from escaping the bearing system.Thrust washers are located on the end of leg journals and between the primary and secondary bearing surfaces to resist axial loading.Most roller cone bits incorporate what appears to be a ball type bearing.This is the cone retention locking system rather than a bearing. The bearing balls are the bit feature that retains cones on their mating journals.The lubrication system contains the stock of lubricant that will,throughout the life of the bearing system provide lubrication to bearings and seals.Each of these features is described in more detail later."}
{"text": "Bearings are commonly manufactured to precise roller tolerances (0.0005 in.)ensure uniform load distribution and are in some cases individually matched to increase bearing life.These improve bearing efficiency and help control temperature.Precise tolerances,in conjunction with contoured rollers,significantly increase bearing capacity compared with previous bearing systems,making it pos- sible for bits to function normally under higher weights on the bit and rotary speeds and still provide longer bearing life."}
{"text": "In hydrodynamic lubrication,heat generated is a func- tion of lubricant viscosity,applied load,and relative speed between cone and journal.As bearing temperature increases,lubricant viscosity and film thickness decrease creating a potential for journal bearing malfunction.Heat generated varies with the square of the speed.A twofold increase in bearing rotational speed produces a fourfold increase in the generation of heat in the bearings.In larger bits,heat generation can be significant and large bearing design must include provisions for removal of heat from the bearing area."}
{"text": "Boundary Lubrication\n\nBoundary lubrication takes place in a transition between hydrodynamic lubrication and metal-to-metal contact in which there is no lubricant film at all.This transition exists because of surface roughness existing on the journal and cone bearing surfaces."}
{"text": "Peaks in surface roughness are called asperities.Asper- ities exist on all machined surfaces;even mirror finishes do not eliminate microscopic asperities on a bearing surface."}
{"text": "As a hydrodynamic film thins due to speed,load or viscosity,asperities touch and boundary lubrication occurs. The degree to which they can be expected to touch varies Bearing materials are carefully selected so that damage that will be done to a bearing by asperity interaction is minimized.The surfaces are designed so that a polishing effect is produced and improved,\"worn-in\"performance results."}
{"text": "In boundary lubrication,heat generated is a function of lubricant film strength,applied load,and the metallurgical properties of the cone and journal surfaces.Rough surfaces generate more heat than those that are smooth,and hard surfaces generate more heat than the soft.As a high pres- sure lubricating film becomes thinner,asperity interaction increases.Heat generated by boundary lubrication is greater than that generated by hydrodynamic lubrication and will eventually cause bearing failure."}
{"text": "The metallurgy of the bearing must be balanced to min- imize heat generation during boundary lubrication.Cone- bearing surfaces are steel.Soft,silver-plated,sleeves are installed on the journal.Silver polishes easily and minor surface irregularities from machining are quickly smoothed. This ensures low friction operation,and uniform lubricant flow over the bearing surface."}
{"text": "Manufacturing tolerances must be precise so that sur- faces run true to their design condition.Roundness of journal and cone surfaces is important.If any part of a bearing is out of round,the effectiveness of the lubrication regime will be adversely affected."}
{"text": "Open Bearing Systems\n\nAir-cooled,nonsealed roller bearings are commonly used for air drilling applications.When air,gas,or mist is used as a drilling fluid,such as blast hole drilling in open pit mines, nonsealed roller bearing bits are used.Open bearing designs rely on drilling fluid for cooling,cleaning,and lubrication of the bearings.If water is injected into the air or gas,bits are equipped with a water separator to prevent water in contact with loaded bearing surfaces and thereby reduce their life. Backflow valves prevent cuttings suspended in water from backing up through the bit into the drill pipe when the flow of air or gas is interrupted."}
{"text": "Seal Systems\n\nIn general,seal systems are classified as either static or dynamic.Roller cone bits use both types of seals.Dynamic seals involve sealing across surfaces that are moving in relationship to one another,as would be the case for a bearing seal.Seal parts or surfaces that do not move in relationship to one another during bit operation,such as the seal between a hydraulic nozzle and the bit to prevent leakage around the joint,are static seals."}
{"text": "often occur in downhole dilling fluids that apply lateral loading on seals that must be resisted."}
{"text": "Bearing Seals\n\nOn a purely practical level,bearing seals have two func- tions:to prevent foreign materials such as mud,cuttings, chemicals,and water from entering the bearings and to prevent bearing lubricant stocks from escaping the bit."}
{"text": "Visualize the difference in the nature of these two duties."}
{"text": "On the interior side,the seal is excluding clean,functional lubricant from escaping the bit,whereas on the exterior side,the seal is excluding dirt and chemicals from penetrat- ing the bit.The separation of these two extremely different functions takes place at a small point between the two sides of a seal.If either of the functions breaks down,the bearings and the bit could be destined for damage or failure.These facts cause most bit manufacturers to aggressively engage in sealing research."}
{"text": "Seal Definitions\n\nIn a rotating bearing,two working sides of a seal are respectively called the energizer,and,the dynamic wear face.These two parts are directly opposite,one to the other, with the energizing portion bearing on the gland and the dynamic wear face bearing against the rotating unit.For the energizing portion of the seal to function properly,it must have a surface against which to react.This is provided by a channel called a seal gland."}
{"text": "The wearing portion of the seal must have the capability to withstand the heat and abrasion generated as the rotating surface passes over it.The energizer,when functioning correctly,is not a high wear area.Ideally,it simply bears against the gland and provides the pushing energy that keeps the wear surface firmly in contact with the rotating unit."}
{"text": "the cavity between the primary and secondary seals is filled with lubricant under pressure,an added impedance to the entry of foreign solids and fluids into the bearing is introduced.Single seal systems must provide both sealing functions with a single seal."}
{"text": "Twin seals stand up well under cycling and uneven bit loading.Seal integrity is maintained in harsh drilling environments such as high rotational speeds,high weights on bit,high dogleg severity,high mud weights,and deep, hot environments."}
{"text": "Lubrication of Seals\n\nSeals must be lubricated to prevent high wear rates and excessive temperatures that could lead to seal material failures.Lubricant for the bearings also serves to lubricate the seals."}
{"text": "4.7.1.2.2 Lubrication Systems and Lubricants\n\nLubricants play a vital role in bearing performance.They provide lubrication for both bearings and seals,and they provide a medium for heat transfer away from the bearings. In popular dual-seal bearing systems,lubricant between primary and secondary seals further serves as an additional sealing element by impeding the migration of foreign matter that may penetrate the primary seal.To achieve these func- tions,lubricants are specially engineered and continually improved.Lubrication systems are engineered to provide reserve storage,positive delivery to the bearing system, capacity for thermal expansion,and pressure equalization with fluids on the bit exterior."}
{"text": "Lubrication systems include a resupply reservoir suf- ficiently large to ensure availability of lubricant for all lubrication functions throughout the life of the bit.A small positive pressure differential in the system ensures flow from reservoir to bearings.The system is vented to equalize internal and external reservoir pressures.Without equalization,a pressure differential between bit exterior and interior could be sufficient to cause seal damage and bearing failure."}
{"text": "Reservoirs are more complex than most would expect."}
{"text": "As temperatures in a bit rise,lubricants expand thermally. Some lubrication systems vent over-volumes resulting from thermal expansion to the bit exterior.Better designs,how- ever,include extra capacity in the lubricant reservoir to accept expansion volumes without necessity for loss of lubricant by venting.Reservoirs are also a point at which heat removed from the bearings by means of the lubricant can be dissipated."}
{"text": "Mono-cone bits drill differently from three cone bits."}
{"text": "exploitation of both mechanisms encouraged by the promise of efficient shoe drill-outs and drilling in formations with hard stingers interrupting otherwise \"soft\"conditions."}
{"text": "The design provides ample space to enable nozzle placements for efficient bottom hole and cutting structure cleaning.Ample space also permits the use of large inserts."}
{"text": "Unlike three-cone bits,most mono-cone inserts cut gage."}
{"text": "The cutting action of two-cone bits similar to that of three-cone bits but the nature of cutting structure geometry is such that fewer inserts simultaneously contact the hole bottom.Penetration per insert is,accordingly,increased providing a particularly beneficial result in applications in which capabilities to place WOB are limited."}
{"text": "The additional space available in two cone designs has several advantages.It is possible to have large cone offset angles that produce increased scraping action at the gage. Space also enables excellent hydraulic characteristics by room for placement of nozzles close to the bottom.It also allows for use of large inserts or teeth that can extend bit life or efficiency."}
{"text": "Two cone bits do have a tendency to bounce and vibrate."}
{"text": "IADC Classification\n\nThe IADC classification system is a four-character design and application related code.The first three characters are always numeric;the last character is always alphabetic.The first digit refers to bit series,the second to bit type,the third to bearings and gage arrangement,and the fourth (alpha) character to bit features."}
{"text": "Type\n\nThe second character in the IADC Categorization System represents bit type,insert,or milled tooth and describes a degree of formation hardness.Types range from 1 through 4."}
{"text": "Limitations of IADC Classification\n\nWhen using IADC coding,keep in mind that it is the bit manufacturer's responsibility to create IADC codes for their bit designs.There is no independent authority monitoring coding.Given the subjectivity of the system,this can put into question whether a bit has been properly positioned."}
{"text": "Partly as a result of dull analyses,bit design processes and product operating efficiencies evolve quite rapidly. Engineers identify successful design features that can be reapplied and unsuccessful features that must be corrected or abandoned;manufacturing units receive feedback on product quality;sales personnel migrate performance gains and avoid duplication of mistakes between similar appli- cations,and so forth.All bit manufacturers require the collection of dull information for every bit run."}
{"text": "direction.This rule is does not correctly define the first cone for some modern bits,however,and it may be necessary to verify with the manufacturer."}
{"text": "Inner Rows Cutting Structure(I)\n\nDull grading begins with evaluation of wear on the inner rows of inserts or teeth,that is,with the cutting elements not touching the wall of the hole bore.Grading involves measurement of combined inner rows structure reduction due to loss,wear,and breakage using the measurement method described previously."}
{"text": "Outer Rows Cutting Structure(O)\n\nThe second step is the outer rows of inserts or teeth,that is,those that touch the wall of the hole bore.Grading involves measurement of combined outer rows teeth or insert structure reduction due to loss,wear,and breakage using the measurement method described previously."}
{"text": "Bearings and Seals Grading(B)\n\nIADC provides separate protocols for estimation of bearing and seal wear in nonsealed and sealed bearing assemblies."}
{"text": "If either any component in the assembly has failed,use the grading code F."}
{"text": "Use grading code N ifitis not possible to determine the condition of both the seal and the bearing."}
{"text": "For two-cone bits,gage is the measured distance from the closer to gage of the gage or heel elements.For bits with bearing or seal failures,out of gage amount can be measured provided that cones do not have axial or radial movement.If nominal ring gages are not available,the true gage condition cannot be determined."}
{"text": "Remarks\n\nThe Remarks category is more important than its title implies.It enables explanation of dull characteristics that do not correctly fit into other categories,and it is the category in which the reason why a bit was removed from service is confirmed."}
{"text": "4.7.1.6 Roller Cone Bit Economics\n\nNo matter what or how good a new product or method may be to a drilling operation,the final result is always measured in terms of cost per foot or meter.Lowest cost per foot indicates to drilling engineers and supervisors which products to use in each situation.Reduced costs lead directly to higher profits or,in some cases,to the difference between profit and loss."}
{"text": "For those in administration,engineering,manufacturing, and sales,cost calculations are used to evaluate the effec- tiveness of any product or method,new or old.Because drilling costs are so important,everyone involved should know how to make a few simple cost calculations."}
{"text": "Break-even analysis on a bit is the most important aspect of an economic evaluation.A break-even analysis is necessary to determine if the added bit cost can be justified for a particular application."}
{"text": "The break-even point for a bit is simply the footage and hours needed to equal the cost per foot that would be obtained on a particular well if the bit were not used.To get the break-even,a good offset well must be used for comparative purposes."}

{"text": "4.Diamonds have a high thermal conductivity."}
{"text": "Diamonds also have some disadvantages as cutting ele- ments:they are very weak in shear strength,have a very low shock impact resistance,and can damage or crack under extremely high temperatures."}
{"text": "When choosing diamonds for a particular drilling situation,there are basically three things to know.First,the quality of the diamond chosen should depend on the forma- tions being drilled.Second,the size of the diamond and its shape will be determined by the formation and anticipated penetration rate.Third,the number of diamonds employed is dictated by the formation and anticipated penetration rate."}
{"text": "There are two types of diamonds,synthetic and natural."}
{"text": "Synthetic diamonds are man made and are used in PDC STRATAPAX type bit designs.STRATAPAX PDC bits are best suited for extremely soft formations.The cutting edge of synthetic diamonds are round,half-moon shaped or pointed."}
{"text": "Natural diamonds are divided into three categories.First are the carbonate or black diamonds.These are the hardest and most expensive diamonds.They are used primarily as gage reinforcement at the shockpoint.Second are the West African diamonds.These are used in abrasive formations and usually are of gemstone quality.About 80%of the West African diamonds are pointed in shape and,therefore,20% are the desirable spherical shape.Third are the Congo or coated diamonds.These are the most common category. Over 98%of these diamonds are spherical by nature.They are extremely effective in soft formations.The other 2%are usually cubed shaped,which is the weakest of the shapes available."}
{"text": "Diamond bits have several design parameters,which include face layout and profile geometry.Face layouts drive fluid course geometries and configurations,which are deemed critical for product performance.In most instances, profiles are classified as round,parabolic,tapered,and flat crown.Profile geometry selection for diamond bits is primarily based on formation characteristics,in terms of formation hardness and abrasiveness.In most instances, profiles for hard and abrasive formations tend to be more parabolic.Additionally,directional drilling objectives also influence profile selection for diamond bits."}

{"text": "3.Deep cones having a 70°apex angle are normally used in drill bits to give built-in stability and to obtain greater diamond concentration in the bit-cone apex."}
{"text": "Diamond Bit Hydraulics\n\nThe hydraulics for diamond bits should accomplish rapid removal of the cuttings,and cooling and lubrication of the diamonds in the bit metal matrix."}
{"text": "Bit Pressure Drop\n\nThe pressure drop across the bit is determined on the rig as the difference in standpipe pressure when the bit is on bottom,and when the bit is off bottom,while maintaining constant flowrate."}
{"text": "Maximum Drilling Rate\n\nIn fast drilling operations(soft formations),the maximum penetration rate is limited by the maximum pressure avail- able at the bit.This is the maximum allowable standpipe pressure minus the total losses in the circulating system."}
{"text": "Marine Core Barrels\n\nMarine barrels were developed for offshore coring where a stronger core barrel is required.They are similar to the conventional core barrels except that they have heavier outer tube walls."}
{"text": "Rotary Speed\n\nDiamond bits can usually be rotated at up to 150 rpm without any problem when hole conditions and drill string design permit.Rotary speeds of 200 and 300 rpm can be used with stabilized drill strings in selected areas.Diamond bits have also operated very successfully with downhole motors at 600 to 900 rpm.The actual rotary speed limits are usually imposed by safety."}
{"text": "Rubber Sleeve Core Barrels\n\nRubber sleeve core barrels are special application tools designed to recover undisturbed core in soft,unconsolidated formations.As the core is cut,it is encased in the rubber sleeve that contains and supports it.Using face discharge ports in the bit,the contamination of the core by circulating fluid is reduced.The rubber sleeve core barrel has proven to be a very effective tool,in spite of the fact that the rubber sleeve becomes weak with a tendency to split as the temperature increases about 175°F."}
{"text": "excessive torque to rotate the bit.Using too much weight can cause the diamonds to penetrate too deeply into a soft formation with an insufficient amount of mud flow able to pass between the diamonds and the formation,resulting in poor removal of the cuttings.The core bit could clog or even burn,and penetration rate and bit life will be reduced.In harder formations,excessive weight will cause burning on the tips ofthe diamonds or shearing with a resulting loss in salvage."}
{"text": "30%to 50%and achieving four times the footage per bit at higher penetration rates.[11,12]."}
{"text": "On a worldwide basis,drag bits operated in soft and medium-hardness formations have set performance records for single-run footage(>22,000 ft),cumulative footage (>18,000 ft in 26 runs),and single-run penetration rate (>2,200 ft/hr)[13].This success has motivated continuing efforts to expand the range of applications for drag bits to increasingly harder formations.Laboratory studies indicate that PDC drag bits can outperform conventional rollerbits in hard rock when they are operated under conditions that minimize frictional heat generation and bit chatter [14]. Field test have confirmed that a properly controlled standard PDC drag-bit design is capable of drilling an extended hard- rock interval at a high rate of penetration.[15]."}
{"text": "The tungsten carbide backing provides mechanical strength and further reinforces the diamond compact wear-resistant properties.During drilling,the polycrys- talline diamond cutter wears down slowly with a self- sharpening effect.This helps maintain sharp cutters for high penetration-rate drilling throughout the life of the bit."}
{"text": "Greater bit design freedom is generally available with matrix body bits because they are \"cast\"in a mold like natural diamond bits.Thus,matrix body bits typically have more complex profiles and incorporate cast nozzles and waterways.In addition to the advantages of bit face configuration and erosion resistance with matrix body bits diamond compact matrix bits often utilize natural diamonds to maintain full gage hole.Matrix body bits generally utilize long,cylinder-shaped cutters secured to the bit by brazing."}
{"text": "Bit Profile\n\nBit profile can significantly affect bit performance based upon the influence it has on bit cleaning,stability,and hole deviation control.The \"double-cone\"profile will help maintain a straight hole even in crooked hole country.The sharp nose will attack and drill the formation aggressively while the apex and reaming flank stabilize the bit.This sharp profile may be more vulnerable to damage when a hard stringer is encountered as only the cutters on the sharp nose will support the impact loading.A shallow cone profile appears to be the easiest to clean due to the concentration of hydraulics on the reduced surface area of the bit face.This profile relies heavily upon the gage section for directional stability.The shallow cone profile will hold direction and angle with sufficient gauge length and proper stabilization of the bit."}

{"text": "A special case is defined:the numbers 6 and 9 describe the crowfoot/water course design of most natural diamond and many TSP bits.Such designs are further described as having either radial flow,crossflow (feeder/collector),or other hydraulics.Thus,the letters R(radial flow).X(cross flow),orO(other)are used as the hydraulic design code for such bits."}

The ultimate combination of small cutters set in a high density pattern is the impregnated bit,designated by the number 0."}
{"text": "Cutter size ranges are defined for natural diamonds based on the number of stones per carat.PDC and TSP cutter sizes are defined based on the amount of usable cutter height.Usable cutter height rather than total cutter height is the functional measure since various anchoring and attachment methods affect the \"exposure\"of the cutting structure.The most common type of PDC cutters,which have a diameter that is slightly more than!in.,were taken as the basis for defining medium size synthetic diamond cutters."}
{"text": "The fifth space will always be an“X”for fixed cutter bits,since there are no bearings.This space can be used to distinguish dull grades for fixed cutter bits from dull grades for roller bits."}

{"text": "4.7.3.3 Downhole Tools\n\nDownhole drilling tools are the components of the lower part of a drill string used in normal drilling operations such as the drill bits,drill collars,stabilizers,shock absorbers, hole openers,underreamers,drillingjars as well as a variety of drill stem subs."}
{"text": "As drill bits,drill collars and drill stem subs are dis- cussed elsewhere,this section regards shock absorbers,jars, underreamers,and stabilizers."}
{"text": "4.7.3.4 Shock Absorbers\n\nExtreme vertical vibrations throughout the drill string are caused by hard,broken or changing formations,and the drilling bit chafing against the bottom formation as it rotates."}
{"text": "In shallow wells,the drill string transmits the vibration oscillations all the way to the crown block of the drilling rig.The effects can be devastating as welds fail,seams split and drill string connections break down under the acceler- ated fatigue caused by the vibrations.In deep holes,these vibrations are rarely noticed due toelasticity and dampening by the long drill string.Unfortunately,the danger of fatigue still remains and has resulted in many fishing operations."}
{"text": "The drill string vibration dampeners are used to absorb and transfer the shock of drilling to the drill collars where it can be borne without damaging or destroying other drill string equipment.Their construction and design vary with each manufacturer.To effectively absorb the vibrations induced by the drill bit,an element with a soft spring action and good dampening characteristics is required.There are six basic spring elements used:(1)vulcanized elastometer, (2)elastomeric element,(3)steel wool,(4)spring steel,(5) Belleville steel springs,and (6)gas compression."}
{"text": "Types of Shock Absorbers\n\nTwo of the eight commonly used commercial shock absorbers are described below."}
{"text": "shock absorber so the critical shocks are in axial directions. These tools cannot be used at temperatures above 200°F. Though they produce a small stroke the dampening effect is good [3]."}
{"text": "The tool features a spline assembly that transmits high torque loads to the bit through its outer tube,while the inner assembly absorbs vibration through a series of steel-disc springs.The spring system works in both suspension and compression."}
{"text": "The high shock-absorbing capabilities of this tool are attained by compression of the stack of springs within a stroke of five inches.The alternating action of the patented spring arrangement provides a wide working range,under all possible conditions of thrust and mud pressure drop."}

{"text": "bottom of the upper end of the drill bit shaft(via a coupling shaft)and imparts an impact load to the drill bit.The drill bit in turn transfers this impact load to the rock face of the bit. This impact load creates a crushing action on the rock face very similar to that discussed earlier in this section.But in this situation,the crushing action is dynamic and is more effective than the quasi-static crushing action of tri-cone and single cone drill bits.Therefore,air hammer drilling operations require far less WOB as comparable drilling operations using tri-cone or single cone drill bits."}
{"text": "The air hammer is made up to the bottom of the drill string and at the bottom of the air hammer is the air hammer bit.The air hammer drill string must be rotated just like a drill string that utilizes tri-cone or single cone drill bits.The rotation of the drill string allows the inserts (i.e.,tungsten carbide studs)on the bit face to move to a different location on the rock face surface.This rotation allows a different position on the rock face to receive the impact load as the upper end of the hammer bit is struck by the hammer.In direct circulation operations,air flow passes through the hammer section,through the drill bit channel and orifices to the annulus,As the air passes into the annulus,the flow entrains the rock cuttings and carries the cuttings to the surface in the annulus.Direct circulation air hammers are available in a wide variety of outside housing diameters (3 inches to 16 inches).These air hammers drill boreholes with diameters from 3g inches to 17inches."}
{"text": "There are five air hammer bit cutting face designs."}
{"text": "manufacturing air hammer bits is complicated.Fortunately, the air hammer has proven in the past decade to be very effective in drilling deep boreholes.This has given rise to competition among traditional drill bit manufacturers to provide improved air hammer bits for deep drilling opera- tions.This competition has in turn resulted in an increase in the quality and durability of air hammer bits (over the traditional air hammer manufacturer-supplied air hammer bits)in the more hostile environments of the deep boreholes. Operational use of the air hammer will be discussed in detail in section 4.10."}
{"text": "detent in the jar at a given overpull value.Ajar is a hollow rod-telescoping cylinder with a detent mechanism that holds the rod in place or cocked position until a predetermined force or overpull valve is obtained.After the detent is released,the rod travels freely until it reaches the end of its stroke,where the jarring action occurs by a sudden impact of a hammer and anvil within the jar."}
{"text": "By definition,the detent is a mechanical device (e.g."}
{"text": "catch,latch,collet,spring-operated ball)for positioning and holding one mechanical part in relation to another so that the device can be released by force applied to one of the parts."}
{"text": "A fishing jar is used to free stuck drill string and is added to the drill string only when the string becomes stuck."}
{"text": "4.7.5.2 Drilling Jar Design\n\nDrilling jars can be classified as mechanical or hydraulic, depending on the trigging method.A third design,which incorporates a hydraulic section for up jarring and a sepa- rate mechanical section for down jarring,is called hydro- mechanical."}
{"text": "This type of hydraulic delay frequently generates heat at a rate that cannot dissipate because this design requires a long metering stroke.This long metering stroke is necessary to allow for changes in the piston/bore radial clearance. The heat build-up in the jar may necessitate periodically stopping the jarring action to allow the jar fluid to cool."}
{"text": "To minimize the heat build-up problem,a hydraulic drillingjar with a time delay/mechanical release detent was designed."}
{"text": "time is designed to allow the operator sufficient time to pull to the desired overpull or apply adequate weight to the jar for a downward action before the triggering valves to open.Like the conventional hydraulic jar,both types do not require presetting or adjustment before running in the well. The overpull and downward jarring forces and directions are controlled from the rig floor."}
{"text": "4.7.6 Underreamers\n\nThe term underreaming has been used interchangeably with hole opening.Underreaming is the process of enlarging the hole bore beginning at some point below the surface using a tool with expanding cutters.This permits lowering the tool through the original hole to the point where enlargement of the hole is to begin."}
{"text": "Hole opening is considered as opening or enlarging the hole from the surface(or casing shoe)downward using a tool with cutter arms at a fixed diameter."}
{"text": "Thus,the proper name for the tools with expandable cut- ting arms is underreamers.The cutting arms are collapsed in the tool body while running the tool in the hole.Once the required depth is reached,mud circulation pressure moves the cutters opening for drilling operation.Additional pres- sure drop across the underreamer orifice gives the operator positive indication that the cutter arms are extended fully and the tool is undereaming at full gauge."}
{"text": "The condition called \"wobble\"exists if the bit centerline does not rotate exactly parallel to and on the hole centerline so the bit is tilted."}
{"text": "Stabilizer Design\n\nThere are three commonly used stabilizer designs."}
{"text": "● Three-point string reamer.The reamer is run in the drill collar string.This reamer provides stabilization of the drill collars to drill a straighter hole in crooked hole country.When run in the string,the reamer is effective in reaming out dog-legs,keyseats and ledges in the hole."}
{"text": "·Six-point bottom hole reamer.This type of reamer is run between the drill collars and the bit when more stabilization or greater reaming capacity is required. Drilling in crooked hole areas with a six-point reamer has proven to be very successful in preventing sharp changes in hole angles."}
{"text": "Reamers are either open bearing design or sealed bearing design with pressure compensation.Open bearing design reamers are used for standard applications.Sealed bearing design reamers are used in more demanding condi- tions where extended reamer life is required."}
{"text": "To employ pendulum effect in directional drilling,usu- ally one stabilizer is placed in the optimum position in the drill collar string.The position is determined by the hole size,drill collar size,angle of deviation and the weight on the bit.A properly placed stabilizer extends the suspended portion of the drilling string (that portion between the bit and the point of contact with the low side of the hole).The force of gravity working on this extended portion results in a stronger force directing the bit toward vertical so the well trajectory returns to vertical."}
{"text": "To employ fulcrum effect one stabilizer is placed just above the bit and additional weight is applied to the bit. The configuration acts as a fulcrum forcing the bit to the high side of the hole.The angle of hole deviation increases (buildup)as more weight is applied."}
{"text": "To employ a restricted fulcrum effect one stabilizer is placed just above the bit while second stabilizer is placed above the nonmagnetic drill collar.The hookup allows a gradual buildup of inclination with no abrupt changes."}
{"text": "To prevent key-seating one stabilizer is placed directly above the top of drill collars.The configuration prevents drillcollars wedging into a key seat during tripping out of the hole."}
{"text": "To prevent differential sticking across depleted sands stabilizers are placed throughout the drill collar string.The area of contact between drill collars and hole is reduced, thus reducing the sticking force."}

{"text": "4.8.5.2 Drilling Operations\n\nIn oil and natural gas producing wells that have relatively low pore pressures,overbalanced drilling operations created formation damage by forcing the drilling mud particles and rock cutting fines into the producing rock formation pores thereby clogging the pores of formation rock in the vicinity of the open borehole.This formation damage reduces the flow of oil and/or natural gas to the wellbore when the well is completed and produced.Great costs are incurred by operating companies to reduce the effects of forma- tion damage in wells that have been drilled with conven- tional overbalanced methods(e.g.,hydraulic fracturing and acidizing)."}
{"text": "Producing oil and natural gas geologic provinces become depleted as they are produced.This depletion is in both volume of oil or gas available for production and in reservoir pressure.To reduce the effects of formation damage,infill drilling and completion operations are carried out in these provinces,the new wells are increasingly being drilled and completed using underbalanced drilling tech- niques.The use of underbalanced drilling and completion techniques is generally confined to the drilling and com- pletion of the rock formations that will produce oil and/or natural gas.Underbalanced drilling operations allow the oil and/or natural gas to flow into the wellbore as drilling pro- cess progresses through these producing rock formations. Special surface production equipment must be in place in order to safely collect these produced fluids and control(via metering)the volumetric flow rate of these fluids(together with the drilling fluid)into the wellbore at the bottom of the well.The metering of these volumetric flow rates is critical to the control of any underbalanced drilling operation. These metering measurements are used to continuously adjust the magnitude of the difference between the pore pressure of the openhole exposed producing formation and the pressure at that formation due to the circulating drilling fluid."}
{"text": "4.8.5.3 Airand Gas Drilling\n\nAir and gas drilling refers to the use of compressed air (or other gases)as the circulating drilling fluid for rotary drilling operations.The majority of these drilling opera- tions use compressed air as the circulating drilling fluid."}

{"text": "7.Determine the required approximate minimum volu- metric flow rate of air (or other gas)to carry the rock cuttings from the well when drilling at the maximum depth."}
{"text": "8.Select the contractor compressor(s)that will provide the drilling operation with a volumetric flow rate of air that is greater than the required minimum volumetric flow rate(use a factor of safety of at least 1.2)."}
{"text": "9.Using the compressor(s)air volumetric flow rate to be injected into the well,determine the bottomhole and surface injection pressures as a function of drilling depth (over the interval to be drilled).Also,determine the maximum power required by the compressor(s)and the available maximum derated power from the prime mover(s)(see Section 3.1,Chapter 3)."}
{"text": "10.Determine the approximate volume of fuel required by the compressor(s)to drill the well."}

{"text": "12.Determine the approximate volumetric flow rate of formation water or formation oil that can be carried from the well during the drilling operation(assuming the injection air will be saturated with water vapor at bottomhole conditions)."}
{"text": "The circulation system for an air (or other gas)drilling operation is a typical compressible fluid flow calculation problem.In these problems,the pressure and temperature is usually known at the exit to the system.In this case, the exit is at the end of the blooey line.At this exit,the pressure and temperature are the local atmospheric pressure and temperature at the drilling location.The calculation procedures for air drilling circulation problems are to start at these known exit conditions and work upstream through the system.In these calculations,the volumetric flow rate must be assumed or known.If compressors are used to provide compressed air,then the volumetric flow rate is the sum of the outputs of all the primary compressors(see Section 3.4)."}
{"text": "The methodology outline above has been successful in predicting bottomhole and injection pressures with an accuracy of about 5%.In order to attain this accuracy,it is necessary to consider all major and minor flow losses in the circulating system,and to account for any water or other incompressible fluids being carried from the well by the air or gas drilling fluid."}

{"text": "The procedure for eliminating mud rings is as follows:\n\n1.Begin injecting sufficient water to saturate the gas flow with water vapor."}
{"text": "2.Curtail drilling ahead but continue gas circulation."}
{"text": "3.Bring the rotations of the drill string up to about 100 rpm and lift the drill string up to the top of the drilling mast and lower it several times.This will allow the drill collars to smash into the mud ring structures and break them off the borehole wall."}

{"text": "bearing rock formations are about to be penetrated,the fol- lowing steps should be taken to reduce the risk of downhole hydrocarbon combustion:\n\n1.Drilling should be immediately stopped."}
{"text": "2.Air injection should be shut off and the gas flare moni- tored.If the flare is sustained by hydrocarbons from the well,the operator should note the wetness ofthe cuttings at the sample catcher (indicting water or distillate in the gas)."}
{"text": "3.If the gas flare will not sustain or burn when the air is turned off,air can be turned back on,and water injection operations initiated,followed by careful bit advancement."}
{"text": "4.If the gas flare is sustained and/or the cuttings are wet,precautions must be taken to eliminate any mud rings before drilling forward.If water injection has not commenced,it should be initiated.With the air on and water injection operations underway,the drill string should be raised and lowered while rotating the drill sring at approximately 100 rpm to smash any existing mud rings in the hole above the hydrocarbon bearing formations.If the injection pressure has not come down after this attempt to clear the mud rings,repeat the above sequence until the operator is satisfied that any mud rings have been successfully cleared.Once satisfied no existing mud rings are present in the borehole,carefully advance the drill bit through the hydrocarbon bearing formations."}
{"text": "Note that an alternative to the above is to switch the drilling gas to natural gas or liquid nitrogen."}

{"text": "The goal of the completion process is to maximize the value of the well once it has been drilled.Itis the completion process that fully prepares the well to flow and puts in place the equipment allowing the safe and economical production of the oil and gas,for which the well was drilled.These two statements imply there might be some benefit if the well is drilled with the final completion type fully considered and that wellbore placement can be used to assist with providing optimum completion efficiency."}
{"text": "Other important factors when planning for a completion are the ability to being able to fully characterize the forma- tion,the type of production,the recovery mechanism(s),and the anticipated required well life.This information can have a significant impact on completion planning,and ultimately, on completion success."}
{"text": "4.9.2 Types of Completions\n\nThere are many different ways that a well can be completed. It seems that the number of completion methods is limited only by individual imagination.Indeed,additional comple- tion methods have recently become prominent as industry has worked to bring additional,unconventional oil and gas to production.There will be more information about these methods later in this section."}
{"text": "Generally speaking,a completion starts as being either an open hole completion,or as a cased hole completion."}
{"text": "primary production enters the wellbore(gas or water for an oil well,water for a gas well),it is more difficult to isolate or shut off,in an open hole completion.Selective,within the zone,treatments are not as straightforward as in a cased hole.Sections of an open hole reservoir are more difficult to effectively isolate than they would be if the same interval was cased and cemented."}
{"text": "The obvious advantage to a cased hole completion is that the producing formation is provided with support by the casing and cement.Therefore,cased holes are typically used when the producing formation is not as strong and can fail easily during production,either initially or as the reservoir depletes."}
{"text": "Another advantage is that it is more straightforward to provide isolation of separate portions within the producing interval.This may be required during production,to remove or isolate unwanted producing fluids,and to more effec- tively stimulate specific reservoir sections."}
{"text": "production in a cased hole well exists.Planning for opti- mized cased hole production is a very important process for each well."}
{"text": "4.9.3.3 Formation Evaluation\n\nMost formation evaluation has already been completed by this time in the drilling and completion of a wellbore. However,it might be that evaluation of the cement quality around the production casing has been planned after mud is removed from the well and replaced with the comple- tion fluid.If that is the case,then cement evaluation can occur at this point.It is important to have a pretty good understanding of the likely isolation provided by the cement behind casing,as well as the top of cement.If the quality is judged to be less than required,remedial cementing can be done in the attempt to make it better.Remedial or squeeze cementing,involves perforating the casing in a limited area, and then breaking down or fracturing the formation and pumping additional cement out the perforations and into the formation.This attempt is made to provide additional cement isolation outside the casing."}
{"text": "In addition,if a workover operation is occurring instead of a brand new completion,then it is likely a cased hole evaluation log of some sort will also be run for the purpose of determining oil and water,oil and gas,and/or gas and water contacts.If run,these logs will be the basis for selecting casing perforation depths."}
{"text": "4.9.3.4 Lower Completion\n\nThe term \"lower completion\"is a broad term describing the parts of the completion operation pertaining to the processes and equipment installation within the reservoir section of either the cased or open hole."}
{"text": "In an open hole,this could mean that nothing additional is required after drilling it.It could also mean the installation of some sort of liner with provision for flow paths into the wellbore,or possibly the installation of a gravel packed screen.If equipment is run into the open hole,it will likely be anchored and sealed(perhaps with a packer)in the casing set and cemented above the production interval.This will help provide for the highest likelihood of long-lived well integrity."}
{"text": "4.9.3.5 Upper Completion\n\nIf there isa separation between the lower completion and the upper completion,there is usually an anchor and a casing seal of some sort(possibly a packer)on the top of the lower completion that the upper completion connects to.Just as the lower completion is critical in establishing the hydraulic connection to reservoir fluids,the upper completion's criti- cal role is to insure long-term wellbore integrity so that the production fluids can be economically,reliably and safely produced to the surface,normally for as long as the reservoir will last.This is planned to be accomplished with no leaks or equipment failures."}
{"text": "The upper completion is designed to be able to safely, and with a designated safety factor,withstand the antic- ipated production loads that will occur over the life of the well.These loads typically include production and injection pressures and temperatures.During production, average wellbore temperature will increase,thereby causing the metallic tubing to get longer,adding to the force it and its anchor (if used)must withstand.During production, average wellbore pressure differential within the tubing will also likely increase.At the same time,during a well's life,injection will also likely occur,causing cooling and a lowering of average wellbore temperature.This,along with applied pressure,also places loads on the tubing and anchors.In order to insure lifelong wellbore integrity,these loads must all be anticipated,and designed and accounted for when installing the upper completion."}
{"text": "4.9.3.6 Final Testing and Displacements\n\nCompletion planning should also include considerations pertaining to testing requirements,and in what condition, with what fluids installed,should the wellbore be left in.It is likely that the final fluids to be left in the well,both in the annulus and in the tubing,will be installed (circulated in) before upper completion operations are complete."}
{"text": "The fluid left in the production tubing could be comple- tion fluid,or it could be something else designed to assist with initiating well production.Examples of this could be a drilling fluid base oil,or a lighter weight brine.This will provide for leaving the well in an underbalanced condition which greatly assists with the start of production."}
{"text": "Completion equipment critical to long-term wellbore integrity and reliability are often tested during the com- pletion process.This equipment,if included,would be the production tubing,the production packer,production seal assemblies,and the safety valve.In many instances,the best practice testing method includes both apositive pressure test (pressuring up on the equipment)and a negative pressure test(lowering pressure above the equipment so that the pressure differential is in the direction of production,from below to above)."}
{"text": "In some instances,the process of testing and establishing final wellbore condition is quite involved,leaving open the opportunity for optimizing the order of testing and other procedural steps so that the wellbore's long-term integrity is assured effectively and efficiently."}
{"text": "Packers can be set with mechanical force(weight and/or rotation).They can also be set with the application of hydraulic pressure."}
{"text": "A retrievable packer is one that is designed to be easily retrieved,either with a straight pull on it,or with a straight pull on a retrieving tool run and latched into the packer."}
{"text": "An additional,more recent packer type that combines robust design and yet can still be removed from the well- bore without milling,is a removable packer.These packers typically require an internal part of the packer be cut with an electric line tool.These packers can then be removed with a straight pull."}
{"text": "Finally,packers that are designed to be run in criti- cal,high-pressure,high-temperature applications will likely have their performance tested and verified in accordance with an accepted industry standard.The purpose of such testing is to insure the packer will reliably and with repeata- bility,perform at its rated pressure,temperature,and load ratings."}
{"text": "4.9.4.2 Packers\n\nThere are many types of packers,designed for specific types and needs of completions.Generally,they perform the function of both an anchor and a seal.They can anchor the tubing,preventing movement.They also provide a seal between the outside of the tubing and the casing.This seal is used to prevent production fluids and pressures from reach- ing the top of the well outside of the tubing,and is a means of providing for reliability and long-lived wellbore integrity."}
{"text": "Packers can be set in open holes or cased holes.They can be for use with single or dual tubing strings.They can be run and set on electric line or on tubing or workstring."}
{"text": "As mentioned,packers can be used to isolate the annulus to provide a barrier,keeping production pressures and fluids from reaching the top of the well through the tubing/casing annulus.Packers are also used to isolate different produc- tion zones and assist with separating their production as required."}
{"text": "4.9.4.4 Tubing\n\nTubing forms an integral part of most completions.If run,it is the conduit by which production fluids reach the surface. Its structural integrity during the entire life of the well is very important.Tubing must be designed to simultaneously withstand production pressures,temperatures,and induced axial forces and not leak.The tubing must also be compati- ble with the fluids it will be in contact with,both internally and externally."}
{"text": "qualification is a requirement is normally established by the end user or also by the government authority with responsi- bility for the well.The purpose of the testing qualification is to verify and insure the connection reliably and repeatedly seals without leaking,under all loads conditions for which it is rated.It is normal for such connections to be rated the same as or greater than the tubing body itself."}
{"text": "In addition to these,there are other additional accessory equipment,including flow couplings,blast joints,and wire- line entry guides,to name a few."}
{"text": "4.9.4.6 Safety Valves\n\nSafety valves run as part of the completion are a critical component of the completion.They are critical to providing containment in the event of a surface equipment malfunc- tion or failure during production."}
{"text": "Most modern completions use tubing retrievable safety valves,except where conditions and rates are benign."}
{"text": "Achieving holes like this through the casing and into the formation can provide for a very effective completion."}
{"text": "There are three parts to a perforating system and its explosive chain.They are the detonator,the detonating cord and the shaped charge.The explosive shaped charge develops intense pressure and penetrates the gun body, wellbore fluid,casing,cement and into the formation."}
{"text": "The perforating operation is one of the potentially most hazardous,due to the high explosives used.This requires strict attention to the care and handling of explosives, ensuring personnel are properly trained."}
{"text": "An explosive detonating wave travels down the detonating cord,initiating the primer and detonating the main explosive.The exploding charge generates on the order of millions of psi,effectively causing the perforat- ing jet to force its way through the gun case,annular fluid, casing,cement,and into the formation.It is the shape of the liner that focuses the explosion."}
{"text": "In general,the shape of the liner primarily determines whether hole size or penetration depth is optimized."}
{"text": "Finally,the amount of explosive used in each charge can vary,depending on the application and the size of the perforating gun.Generally speaking,perforating larger size casing willrequire higher explosive performance,implying larger amounts of explosives in each charge."}
{"text": "adverse consequence of producing solids with oil and gas has led to the development of methods designed to control solids production while still allowing efficient oil and gas production.A brief description of the major methods,along with relative advantages will be discussed."}
{"text": "Oriented or Selective Perforating—This method of sand control takes advantage of in-situ formation stresses and knowledge of the higher strength areas of the formation. Selective perforating shoots only the stronger sections of the formations as determined by logs and/or core samples. Oriented perforating shoots in the direction of maximum horizontal formation stresses.This can promote perforation tunnel stability.Of course,the ability to orient the perfo- rating guns is critical.This method of sand control adds a little completion cost in the perforating operation.At the same time,there is still sand production risk since there is no physical sand barrier put in place."}
{"text": "In-Situ Consolidation—This method of sand control injects plastic resin or other chemical to consolidate and add strength to the formation.It is injected below frac pressure and is normally limited to short intervals.However,this may be a viable alternative and has been effective,if properly applied."}
{"text": "is not installed properly,the screens are likely to erode or plug or both,leading to a potential well failure.Sophisti- cated testing methods have been developed to enhance the success of the screen-only method.However,installation and initiating production still require careful planning in order to prevent premature failure."}
{"text": "Gravel Pack or Expandable Screens—Expandable screens are enhanced versions of standalone screens from the standpoint that the screens are designed to be expanded against the formation face in the open hole,or against the casing,in a cased hole.This provides the benefit of preventing excessive movement along the outside of the screen,by the formation particles.This can reduce the chances for erosion,and increase the likelihood of effective sand control."}
{"text": "Generally speaking,the proppant or gravel pack sand is sized to contain for formation sand.The screen is sized to hold back the proppant or gravel,or the formation sand."}
{"text": "This is the most expensive sand control,but also the most effective from productivity and reliability standpoints."}
{"text": "4.9.8 Unconventional Completions\n\nUnconventional wells are those oil and gas wells charac- terized by extremely low reservoir permeability's requiring significant stimulation in order to produce at economic rates.In a lot of cases,these producing formations are shale. Horizontal wells are drilled through these formations and then the wells are stimulated all along the horizontal length. The two main methods of horizontal multistage completions currently in use are cemented liner\"plug and perf\"and open hole multistage-fracturing systems."}
{"text": "Cemented Liner Multistage Fracturing—With this method,a production casing is cemented in place in the horizontal wellbore.Completion operations include setting bridge plugs,followed by perforating and then fracturing the perforated interval.This process is repeated for as many times as necessary to cover the horizontal section.When complete,the bridge plugs are drilled out,re-establishing reservoir connectivity to the wellbore.This method is rela- tively expensive and time consuming."}
{"text": "Out of plane perforations can be effective-if the perforations are clean and wellconnected to the formation."}
{"text": "Fractures may propagate from cement interface and help pack perforations."}
{"text": "Open Hole Multistage Fracturing-With this system, multiple open hole packers,and frac ports/sleeves are run in the hole all at once.The open hole packers are all set simultaneously.Once this is done,the rig can leave. The frac ports/sleeves create openings between the packers. These tools can be opened hydraulically by dropping size- specific actuation balls into the system to shift the sleeve and expose the fracturing port.The balls create internal isolation between stages.All frac treatments are performed in a single,continuous pumping operation.Once the treatment is complete,the well can be flowed back immediately."}
{"text": "4.9.9 Intelligent Well Completions\n\nThe generally accepted definition of an intelligent well com- pletion is a permanent system capable of collecting,trans- mitting and analyzing wellbore production and reservoir and completion integrity data,and enabling remote action to better control reservoir,well and production processes. Remote completion monitoring is defined as the ability of a system to provide data,obtained in or near the wellbore, without requiring access and entry for conventional inter- vention to the well.Remote completion control implies that information and instructions can be transmitted into the well to alter the position or status of one or more completion components.The primary objectives of these abilities are normally to maximize or optimize production and recovery, minimize operating costs and improve safety [1,2]."}
{"text": "To summarize,the team(s)charged with specifying well performance capabilities should be able to demonstrate the incremental value of intelligent well installation,just as well drilling and completion must be economically justified."}
{"text": "4.9.10 Artificial Lift\n\nArtificial lift is the method of adding energy to the flow stream within the completion to increase the flow rate. Defined another way,the primary purpose of artificial lift methods is to lower the flowing bottom hole pressure so that the difference between it and the reservoir pressure is increased sufficiently to optimize production from the well.The most common methods of artificial lift are gas lift,rod pumps,electrical submersible pumps,progres- sive cavity pumps,plunger lift,and jet pumps.When designing the completion,it is apparent that considera- tion for the type of artificial lift to be used,must be included in completion design.A brief description of each method follows."}
{"text": "The method works by injecting the optimum amount of gas based on reservoir pressure and PI.This method is the most common method offshore,and is the second most common method overall."}
{"text": "Rod Pump (Beam)—Rod pumps are the most common form of artificial lift,used mostly in land wells.They utilize a reciprocating rod to move a downhole pump.The downhole pump consists of a traveling and a standing valve, which each utilize a check valve to trap and mechanically lift the column of fluid to surface.This type of system handles gas and solids fairly well.Its use is common for low-volume producers."}
{"text": "Progressive Cavity Pumps—Progressive cavity pumps or PCP's are also powered from the surface with a drive unit to rotate a rod string and drive a downhole cavity pump.The pump consists ofa rotor(polished helical-shaped rod)rotating inside the cavity of a stator (double-helical elastomer-liner cylinder),which causes fluid to become trapped in a moving cavity.These pumps are also good for handling gas and solids.They are best for low-volume producers,and,because of the rotating rod,are also limited in depth to about 6000 ft TVD."}
{"text": "Plunger Lift—Plunger lift systems utilize a standing valve and traveling plunger inside a tubing string.This allows reservoir fluid to accumulate on top of the plunger. Pressurized gas is periodically injected downhole below the plunger to push it up the production tubing,carrying a slug of reservoir fluid with it to the surface.Once the plug reaches the surface,the gas supply is shut off,allowing the plunger to fall back down to the standing valve.Naturally, this type of artificial lift requires a gas source.It doesn't handle solids that well,and tends to get stuck.This method is also best for low-volume wells."}
{"text": "Jet Pump—The jet pump utilizes a pressurized power fluid directed at high velocity through a downhole nozzle and across a venturi body.The resulting low-pressure zone downstream of the venturi allows reservoir fluids to be drawn in and mixed with the power fluid.The momentum of the combined power and reservoir fluid stream pushes the fluid column to the surface.There are no downhole moving parts.However a surface pump is required.This method has the worst lift efficiency of all artificial lift methods.It is marginal when handling solids and gas,but does have a wide range of production rates,from about 300 to 15,000 barrels of fluid per day."}
{"text": "Prepare a well basis of design—This document contains the main decisions made during the course of the comple- tion design and their justification.It provides a historical record of considerations and decisions made,and can be used as an assurance review document to help insure the quality of the overall design.This document should be very detailed and include all elements driving and affecting any element of design,including metallurgy,ratings,sizes, equipment types,etc."}
{"text": "Completion procedure preparation and review—This is an acknowledged critical part of the completion design and preparation process since,in many cases,experienced personnel not directly associated with preparing for the completion have the opportunity to review and approve just about every aspect of the completion itself."}
{"text": "Post completion review—Equally important but often only superficially performed is the detailed,in-depth review of the performance of the completion installation process. Also included should be an assessment of how well the completion was designed,and how well its design met per- formance expectations.This sort of information can be very important to any person planning a later well completion or intervention."}
{"text": "4.9.12 Summary\n\nThis section discussing well completions is a very brief introduction to the vast body of knowledge encompass- ing them and their design considerations.Hopefully the information provided is successful in communicating that there is wide latitude in the complexity,cost,performance, reliability and longevity of completions.The selection of completion capabilities and performance should be driven by the reservoir.In other words,every piece of equipment, and every completion process should be able to be justified from the standpoint of personnel and environment safety and economic return."}

{"text": "As drilling technology moved the pursuit of hydro- carbon resources into higher-cost offshore and hostile environments,intentionally deviated boreholes required information such as azimuth and inclination that could not be derived by surface instruments.Survery instruments, either lowered on a sand line or dropped into the drill pipe for later retrieval,to some degree satisfied the requirements but consumed expensive rig time and sometimes produced questionable results\n\nFor many years researchers Looked for a simple,reliable measurement while drilling technique,referred to by its abbreviation MWD.As early as 1939,a logging while drilling(LWD)system,using an electric wire,was tested successfully but was not commercialized [1,2].Mud pulse systems were first proposed in 1963[3,4].The first mechan- ical mud pulse system was marketed in 1964 by Teledrift for transmitting directional information [5].In the early 1970s,the steering tool,an electric wire operated direc- tional tool,gave the first real-time measurements while the directional buildup was in progress.Finally,the first modern mud pulse data transmission system was commercialized in 1977 by Teleco [6].State-of-the-art surveys of the tech- nology were made in 1978 [7],in 1988 [7-10],and in 1990 [11]."}
{"text": "A problem with the early MWD mud pulse systems was the very slow rate of data transmission.Several minutes were needed to transmit one set of directional data.Anadrill (former subsidiary of Schlumberger)working with a Mobil patent [12]developed in the early 1980s a continuous wave system with a much faster data rate.It became possible to transmit many more drilling data,and also to transmit logging data making LWD possible.Today,as many as 16 parameters can be transmitted in 16 s.The dream of the early pioneers has been more than fulfilled since azimuth, inclination,tool face,downhole weight-on-bit,downhole torque,shocks,caliper,resistivity,gamma ray,neutron, density,Pe,sonic and more can be transmitted in real time to the rig floor and the main office."}

{"text": "The kick-off procedure required numerous single-shot runs to start the deviation in the correct direction.Since, during this phase,the drillpipe was not rotating a steering tool was developed to be lowered on an electric wireline instead of the single shot.The measurements were then made while drilling."}

{"text": "The steering tools have practically been abandoned and replaced by MWD systems,mostly because of the electric wireline.However,the high data rate of the electric wireline (20-30 kbits/s)compared to the low data rate of the MWD systems(1-10 bits/s)make the wireline tools still useful for scientific work."}

{"text": "another voltage pulse of the same amplitude but of opposite polarity or sign.Because of this voltage pulse occurring at twice the driving voltage frequency,the flux gate is sometime known as \"second harmonic magnetometer\"."}
{"text": "The main advantages of the flux gate magnetometers are that they are solid state devices much less sensitive to vibration than compasses,they have uniaxial sensitivity,and sensitivity,and they are very accurate."}
{"text": "2.If we change the tool face angle to -30°(turning left),what will be the probable borehole deviation and azimuth after drilling another motor length?Use the same computer program."}
{"text": "Note:We will assume that the borehole axis is the same as the drill collar axis at the steering tool depth and also that the borehole axis is the same as the mud motor axis at the mud motor depth."}
{"text": "Solution\n\nThe same algorithms are used as in Example 3.The vector Z(0,0,1)is replaced by vector Z(sin 2°·cos TF, sin 2°·sin TF,cos 2°),This new vector Z should be used to compute the new inclination,using the scalar product between vector G and new vector Z.The new vector Z should also be used to compute the new azimuth."}
{"text": "and angular vibration is encountered for thistype of drilling. In deviated rotary drilling,the rubbing of the drill string on the well wall reduces axial vibrations,but the stabilizers increase angular vibrations.In drilling with a downhole motor,the rubbing of the bent sub on the well wall reduces the amplitude of all vibrations."}
{"text": "halts in the mule shoe or from an obstruction in the string. The measuring devices used while drilling are generally subjected to axial and angular impacts caused by the bounc- ing of the bit on the bottom and by the catching of the rollers and stabilizers on the borehole walls."}
{"text": "The tool generates at bottom positive pulses by restrict- ing momentarily the flow of mud each time that the mud flow (pumps)is started.The pulses are detected at the surface on the stand pipe and recorded as a function of time."}
{"text": "When the circulation is started,the poppet valve travels slowly down,generating one pressure pulse when passing each restriction.The measurement range in the standard tool is of 2.5°(also 7°ranges,1°increments,max.17°)."}

{"text": "These tools are still available but tend to be replaced by the MWD systems."}
{"text": "Transmission by Positive Pulses\n\nThis system is by far the most common.It is placed in a nonmagnetic drill collar containing sensors of the flux-gate type for measuring the direction of the earth's magnetic field and accelerometers for measuring the gravity vector.An electromagnetic and electronic unit,every time rotation is halted,calculates and memorizes the azimuth,drift and tool face angles.Bottomhole electric power is supplied by an AC generator coupled with a turbine situated on the mud stream in the drill collar,or by batteries."}
{"text": "When using a mud motor,the △P due to the restriction must be added to the△Pdue to the motor and the bit nozzles."}
{"text": "Transmission by Negative Pulses\n\nDrilling with a nozzle bit or with a downhole motor intro- duces a differential pressure between the inside and the outside of drill collars.This differential pressure can be changed by opening a valve and creating a communication between the inside of the drill string and the annular space. In this way,negative pulses are created that can be used to transmit digital data in the same way as positive pulses. Halliburton and other companies are marketing devices using this transmission principle."}
{"text": "Equation 4.11.8 can be used to calculate the pressure change inside the drill collars by changing the cross- sectional area Ao from bit nozzles only to bit nozzles plus the pulser nozzle."}
{"text": "The early system was transmitting 1.5 bits/s(4 sine wave to identify one bit).Later systems went to 3 bits/s.Now with a 24-Hz carrier frequency,6 bits/s canbe transmitted."}
{"text": "Then,with data compression techniques(sending only changes for most of the words in the frame and rotating the data),an effective transmission rate of 10 bits/s can be achieved."}
{"text": "The continuous wave technique has a definite advantage over the other techniques:a very narrow band of frequencies is needed to transmit the information.The pulse techniques, on the contrary,use a large band of frequencies,and the various noises,pump noises in particular,are more difficult to eliminate."}
{"text": "In principle,several channels of information could be transmitted simultaneously with the continuous wave tech- nique.In particular,a downward channel to control the tool modes and an upward channel to bring up the information. However,continuous wave transmission requires well main- tained pumps and rig circulation system."}
{"text": "Downhole Recording\n\nMost MWD service companies offer the possibility of recording the data versus time downhole.The memories available may reach several megabytes,allowing the record- ing of many parameter values during many hours.This information is particularly valuable when the mud pulse link breaks down.The data can be dumped in a computer,during the following drillpipe."}
{"text": "Electromagnetic Transmission Systems\n\nOne system uses a low-frequency antenna built in the drill collars.This system is a two-way electromagnetic arrange- ment allowing communication from bottom to surface for data transmission and from surface to bottom to activate or modify the tool mode.At any time the sequence of the transmitted parameters,as well as the transmission rate, can be modified.The tool is battery powered and can work without mud circulation.The receiver is connected between the pipe string and an electrode away from the rig for the bottom to surface mode.This system can be used on-or off- shore in theory.Two tools are available:the directional tool, which transmits inclination,azimuth,gravity tool face or magnetic tool face,magnetic field inclination and intensity, and the formation evaluation tool,which measures gamma ray and resistivity.The formation evaluation data are stored downhole in a memory that can be interrogated from the surface or transferred to a computer when pulling out."}

{"text": "The sensitive axis is along the straight part of the con- ducting foil.When elongated,this conducting foil increases in resistance.The change in resistance is very low.Two gages are usually used and mounted in a Wheatstone bridge. Two more gages not submitted to the strain are also used to compensate for temperature variation."}
{"text": "Using two gages in opposite legs of the bridge will double the sensitivity."}
{"text": "One steel disphragm is exposed to the internal pressure, the other is exposed to the external pressure.Four gages are normally used.Two of them are sensitive to pressure and temperature,and two are sensitive to the tempera- ture.A Wheatstone bridge is used for detection of the pressure."}
{"text": "Downhole Shocks Measurements\n\nAn accelerometer in the MWD telemetry tool measures transverse accelerations,or shocks,that may be damaging for the bottomhole assemblies.When acceleration exceeds a certain threshold,the event is signaled to the surface as being a shock.These events versus time or depth are displayed as shock count.This information is used as a warning against excessive downhole vibrations and to alert the driller to change the rpm or weight on the bit[18]."}
{"text": "Downhole Flowrate Measurement\n\nAnadrill's basic MWD tool can be set up to monitor the alternator voltage being produced by the mud flowing across the MWD turbine downhole.By comparing this voltage to the standpipe pressure and the pump stroke rate,the surface system shows that a washout in the drill string is occurring much quicker than with conventional methods [18]."}
{"text": "Downhole pressure subs may achieve the same result as most pressure tools supply internal as well as annular pressure while circulating."}

The gamma rays reaching the borehole form a spectrum typical of each formation extending from a few keV to several MeV."}
{"text": "The gamma rays are detected today with sodium iodide crystals scintillation counters.The counters,6 to 112 in. long(15 to 30 cm)are shock mounted and housed in the drill collars.Several types of measurements can be made: total gamma rays,direction-focused gamma rays,spectral gamma rays."}
{"text": "Total Gamma Rays\n\nTotal gamma ray logs have been run on electric wireline since 1940.The sondes are rather small in diameter(1.5 to 4 in.or 37 to 100 mm).The steel housing rarely exceeds 0.5 in.(12 mm)and a calibration is done in terms of API units, arbitrary units defined in a standard calibration pit located at the University of Houston."}
{"text": "While early MWD total gamma ray tools could not be calibrated in the standard pit since they are too large,newer smaller tools can.Their calibration in API units was difficult because it varies with the spectral content of the radiation. By spectral matching the MWD logs we made to closely resemble the wireline logs.The logs which were recorded by the MWD companies in counts per second(cps)were then recorded in API units."}
{"text": "from 2 to 6s.Consequently,the log values are somewhat distorted and inaccurate."}
{"text": "To summarize,the total gamma ray measurements are used for real-time correlation,lithology identification,depth marker,and kick-off point selection."}
{"text": "By rotating the tool,one can differentiate between the level of gamma rays entering from the top and the lower part of the borehole.A sinusoidal response is recorded which depends on the following:\n\n● distance from the bed boundary."}
{"text": "● gamma ray intensity of the bed in which the tool is in."}

{"text": "● the shielding efficiency of the tungsten sleeve."}
{"text": "● Radioactive events occur in the measured depth interval (8,100-8,200 ft)with no displacement of the low/high side gamma ray logs.The radioactive events must be perpendicular to the gamma detector and could be indi- cations of vertical natural fractures in the formation."}

{"text": "The energy of the detected neutrons has an epithermal component because a high percentage of the incoming thermal neutron flux is absorbed as it passes through 1 in. of drill collar steel.Furthermore,a wrap of cadmium under the detector banks shields them from the thermal neutron arriving from the inner mud channel.This mainly epither- mal detection practically eliminates adverse effects caused by thermal neutron absorbers in the borehole or in the formation,such as boron."}

{"text": "Photoelectric(Pe)Curve\n\nThe Compton effect(change in gamma ray energy by inter- action with the formation electrons)is used for measuring the density of the formation.The energy range is 200 to 450 keV.The photoelectric effect(absorption of a low- energy gamma due to ejection of a low orbital electron from its orbit)is seen for gamma in an energy range of 35 to 100 keV."}

{"text": "The first practical applications of the downhole motor concept came in 1924 when engineers in the United States and the Soviet Union began to design,fabricate and field test both single-stage and multistage downhole turbine motors [2].Efforts continued in the United States,the Soviet Union and elsewhere in Europe to develop an industrially reliable downhole turbine motor that would operate on drilling mud.But during the decade to follow,all efforts proved unsuccessful."}
{"text": "In 1934 in the Soviet Union a renewed effort was initiated to develop a multistage downhole turbine motor [2-5].This new effort was successful.This development effort marked the beginning of industrial use of the down- hole turbine motor.The Soviet Union continued the devel- opment of the downhole turbine motor and utilized the technology to drill the majority of its oil and gas wells. By the 1950s the Soviet Union was drilling nearly 80% of their wells with the downhole turbine motors using surface pumped drilling mud or freshwater as the activating hydraulic power."}
{"text": "In the late 1950s,with the growing need in the United States and elsewhere in the world for directional drilling capabilities,the drilling industry in the United States and elsewhere began to reconsider the downhole turbine motor technology.There are presently three service companies that offer downhole turbine motors for drilling of oil and gas wells.These motors are now used extensively throughout the world for directional drilling operations and for some straight-hole drilling operations."}
{"text": "The downhole turbine motors that are hydraulically operated have some fundamental limitations.One of these is high rotary speed of the motor and drill bit.The high rotary speeds limit the use of downhole turbine motors when drilling with roller rock bits.The high speed of these direct drive motors shortens the life of the roller rock bit."}
{"text": "In the 1980s in the United States an effort was initiated to develop a downhole turbine motor that was activated by compressed air.This motor was provided with a gear reducer transmission.This downhole pneumatic turbine has been successfully field tested [6,7]."}
{"text": "The development of positive displacement downhole motors began in the late 1950s.The initial development was the result of a United States patent filed by W.Clark in 1957. This downhole motor was based on the original work of a French engineer,René Monineau,and is classified as a helimotor.The motor is actuated by drilling mud pumped from the surface.There are two other types of positive displacement motors that have been used,or are at present in use today:the vane motor and the reciprocating motor. However,by far the most widely used positive displacement motor is the helimotor [2]."}
{"text": "The initial work in the United States led to the highly successful single-lobe helimotor.From the late 1950s until the late 1980s there have been a number of other versions of the helimotor developed and fielded.In general,most of the recent development work in helimotors has centered around multilobe motors.The higher the lobe system,the lower the speed of these direct drive motors and the higher the operating torque."}
{"text": "There have been some efforts over the past three decades to develop positive development vane motors and recip- rocating motors for operation with drilling mud as the actuating fluid.These efforts have not been successful."}
{"text": "In the early 1960s efforts were made in the United States to operate vane motors and reciprocating motors with compressed air.The vane motors experienced some limited test success but were not competitive in the market of that day [7].Out of these development efforts evolved the reciprocating(compressed)air hammers that have been quite successful and are operated extensively in the mining industry and have some limited application in the oil and gas industry [8].The air hammer is not a motor in the true sense of rotating equipment.The reciprocating action of the air hammer provides a percussion effect on the drill bit,the rotation of the bit to new rock face location is carried out by the conventional rotation of the drill string."}

{"text": "The main advantages of the downhole turbine motor are:\n\n1.Hard to extremely hard competent rock formations can be drilled with turbine motors using diamond or the new polycrystalline diamond bits."}
{"text": "2.Rather high rates of penetration can be achieved since bit rotation speeds are high."}
{"text": "3.Will allow circulation of the borehole regardless of motor horsepower or torque being produced by the motor.Circulation can even take place when the motor is installed."}
{"text": "The main disadvantages of the downhole turbine motor are:\n\n1.Motor speeds and,therefore,bit speeds are high,which limits the use of roller rock bits."}
{"text": "4.Because of the necessity to use many stages in the turbine motor to obtain the needed power to drill,the downhole turbine motor is often quite long.Thus the ability to use these motors for high-angle course correc- tions can be limited."}
{"text": "5.Downhole turbine motors are sensitive to fouling agents in the mud;therefore,when running a turbine motor steps must be taken to provide particle-free drilling mud."}
{"text": "6.Downhole turbine motors can only be operated with drilling mud."}
{"text": "A turbine device has the unique characteristic that it will allow circulation independent of what torque or horsepower the motor is producing.In the example where the turbine motor has a 10-lb/gal mud circulating at 400 gal/min,the pressure drop through the motor is about 1,324 psi.This pressure drop is approximately constant through the entire speed range of the motor."}
{"text": "If the turbine motor is lifted off the bottom of the borehole and circulation continues,the motor will speed up to the runaway speed of 1,614 rpm.In this situation the motor produces no drilling torque or horsepower."}
{"text": "As the turbine motor is lowered and weight is placed on the motor and thus the bit,the motor begins to slow its speed and produce torque and horsepower.When sufficient weight has been placed on the turbine motor,the example motor will produce its maximum possible horsepower of 217. This will be at a speed of 807 rpm.The torque produced by the motor at this speed willbe 1,412 ft-lb."}
{"text": "If more weight is added to the turbine motor and the bit,the motor speed and horsepower output will con- tinue to decrease.The torque,however,will continue to increase."}
{"text": "When sufficient weight has been placed on the turbine motor and bit,the motor will cease to rotate and the motor is described as being stalled.At this condition,the turbine motor produces its maximum possible torque.Even when the motor is stalled,the drilling mud is still circulating and the pressure drop is approximately 1,324 psi."}
{"text": "The major reason most turbine motors are designed with various add-on motor sections is to allow flexibility when applying turbine motors to operational situations."}
{"text": "speed).The high power increase rate of penetration and the lower speed increase bit life particularly if roller rock bits are used."}
{"text": "For deviation control drilling the turbine motor with a lower torque and the shortest overall length is needed."}

{"text": "of stages in a turbine motor.A typical positive displacement motor has from two to seven chambers."}
{"text": "The dump valve is used above the motor to allow the drill string to fill when tripping into the hole and drain when tripping out of hole.Top Sub is a crossover,used instead of a Dump Sub,to provide a catch shoulder for the rotor catch.This is a fail-safe mechanism to enable the retrieval of the motor assembly should a failure of the upper stator connection occur.Top Subs may be bored on their upper ends to accept float valves."}
{"text": "The power section is composed of only two continuous parts,the rotor and the stator.Although they are continuous parts,they usually constitute several chambers.In general, the longer the motor section,the more chambers.The stator is an elastomer tube formed to be the inside surface of a rigid cylinder.This elastomer tube stator is of a special mate- rial and shape.The material resists abrasion and damage from drilling muds containing cuttings and hydrocarbons."}
{"text": "The rotors are eccentric in their rotation at the bottom of the motor section.Thus,the connecting rod section provides a flexible coupling between the rotor and the main drive shaft located in the thrust and radial bearing section. The main drive shaft has the drill bit connected to its bottom end."}
{"text": "There are,of course,variations on the downhole positive displacement motor design,but the basic sections discussed above will be common to all designs."}
{"text": "The main advantages of the downhole positive displace- ments motor are:\n\n1.Soft,medium and hard rock formations can be drilled with a positive displacement motor using nearly and type of rock bit."}
{"text": "2.Rather moderate flow rates and pressures are required to operate the positive displacement motor.Thus,most surface pump systems can be used to operate these downhole motors."}
{"text": "can be used to monitor the operation of the motor downhole."}
{"text": "5.Positive displacement motors can be operated with aer- ated muds,foam and air mist."}
{"text": "The main disadvantages ofthe downhole positive displace- ment motors are\n\n1.When the rotor shaft of the positive displacement motor is not rotating,the surface pump pressure will rise sharply and little fluid will pass through the motor."}
{"text": "2.The elastomer of the stator can be damaged by high temperatures and some hydrocarbons."}
{"text": "can compensate for this increased torque by increasing the pressure on the constant flowrate through the motor.In this example the limit in pressure drop across the motor is about 580 psi.Beyond this limit there will be either extensive leakage or damage to the motor,or both."}
{"text": "If the positive displacement motor is lifted off the bottom of the borehole and circulation continues,the motor will simply continue to rotate at 408 rpm.The differential pres- sure,however,will drop to the value necessary to overcome internal friction and rotate,about 100 psi.In this situation the motor produces no drilling torque or horsepower."}
{"text": "As the positive displacement motor is lowered and weight is placed on the motor and thus the bit,the motor speed continues but the differential pressure increases, resulting in an increase in torque and horsepower.As more weight is added to the positive displacement motor and bit, the torque and horsepower will continue to increase with increasing differentiated pressure (i.e.,standpipe pressure)."}
{"text": "The amount of torque and power can be determined by the pressure change at the standpipe at the surface between the unloaded condition and the loaded condition.If too much weight is placed on the motor,the differential pressure limit for the motor will be reached and there will be leakage or a mechanical failure in the motor."}
{"text": "The rotor of the Moineau-type positive displacement motor has a helical design.The axial wave number of the rotor is one less than the axial wave number for the stator for a given chamber.This allows the formation of a series of fluid cavities as the rotor rotates.The number of stator wave lengths ng and the number of rotor wave length nr per chamber are related by [2,9]."}
{"text": "driller.The low torque minimizes the compensation that must be made in course planning which must be made for the reaction torque in the lower part of the drill string. This reactive torque when severe can create difficulties in deviation control planning.The tradeoff is,however,that higher speed reduces the bit life,especially roller rock bit life."}
{"text": "The above hydraulic equivalent diameter is close enough to the one obtained with Equation 4.12.54.Therefore,the bit should have three 2-in.diameter nozzles."}
{"text": "cuttings transport is suspended during this upward stroke of the piston."}
{"text": "When the piston reaches the top of its stroke,another one of the piston ports aligns with one of the control rod windows and supplies compressed air to the open space above the piston.This air flow forces the piston downward until it impacts the top of the bit shank.At the same instant the air flows to the space above the piston,the foot valve at the bottom of the control rod opens and air inside the drill string is exhaust through the control rod,bit shank, and the bit orifices to the rock face.This compressed air exhaust entrains the rock cuttings created by the drill bit for transport up the annulus to the surface.This impact force on the bit allows the rotary action of the drill bit to be very effective in destroying rock at the rock face.This in turn allows the air hammer to drill with low WOB.Typically for a 62inch outside diameter air hammer drilling with a 7ginch air hammer bit,the WOB can be as low as 1,500 lb.Downhole air hammers must have an oil type lubricant injected into the injected air during the drilling operation. This lubricant is needed to lubricate the piston surfaces as it moves in the hammer housing.Air hammers are used exclusively for vertical drilling operations."}
{"text": "Downhole air hammers are available in housing outside diameters from 3 inches to 16 inches.The 3 inch housing outside diameter hammer can drill a borehole as small as 38inches.The 16 inch housing outside diameter hammer can drill a boreholes from 17,inches to 33 inches.For shallow drilling operations,conventional air hammer bits are adequate.For deep drilling operations(usually oil and gas recovery wells),higher quality oil field air hammer drill bits are required."}
{"text": "part in the efficiency and performance of the hammer under different conditions."}
{"text": "\"wash out\".These hammers have a special piston design incorporating a very large bottom volume to reduce the compression ration making them less sensitive to back pres- sure.DTH hammers are not as efficient as normal drilling because of the extra piston mass and air consumption.A standard hammer can be made to work in high back pressure applications by boosting the air pressure thereby increasing air consumption and improving flushing."}
{"text": "To overcome this limitation,in the early 1990s rotary steerable systems(RSSs)were developed.RSS allows con- tinuous rotation of the drillstring while steering the bit. This reduces drag,improves ROP,decreases the risk of sticking,and achieves superior hole cleaning.RSSs can be categorized by their steering mode,\"push the bit\"and “point the bit”."}

{"text": "Section reviewed by Thomas Carter and John Lofton\n\nThe objective of optimizing drilling practices is to safely deliver a product capable of the highest production capacity in a cost-effective manner.Throughout all phases of well planning and construction,the following ideas must be considered:health,safety,and environment (HSE),produc- tion capability,and drilling optimization.These criteria are requisite to delivering a successful drilling outcome.Sev- eral choices are normally available to achieve the required outcomes for each criterion,but fewer options,perhaps only one,may be viable to meet the needs of all three."}
{"text": "In today's environment,HSE requirements play an equal\n\nrole in the planning and implementation of drilling plans. Significant planning is required to protect operating per- sonnel,retain licenses to operate,control costs,and coexist with the environment.Accidents are costly,more so than the up-front costs to mitigate the risk to people,property, and environment."}
{"text": "Production capacity,both rate and volume,are affected by decisions made during planning and construction phases. Proper selection of various cost control options can mini- mize the negative influences that some of these measures can have on production.Analyzing potential gains in capac- ity associated with incremental risk and investment is part of the optimization process."}
{"text": "The main reasons companies in the current era support strong HSE programs include humanitarian reasons (i.e, not hurting people),legal or regulatory requirements,the company's public image,employee morale,and economic reasons (i.e.,loss of business or the cost of poor HSE performance)."}
{"text": "The modern era of HSE management for oil field operations began with the Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea,where 167 men lost their lives in one incident. The subsequent investigation,conducted and published by Lord Cullen,contained the framework of HSE management embodied in much subsequent legislation and regulation [1].This was the birth of safety cases for oil field facilities, including offshore MODU drilling rigs."}
{"text": "Generally,each drilling department should have a set of operating guidelines that control the drilling work pro- cesses.The operating guidelines are a subset of the SMSs, and the documents may vary from multivolume sets at the major oil companies to much smaller documents for smaller companies.The drilling engineer is responsible for ensuring that all his work complies with these guidance instructions. Variations from these procedures usually will require a higher level of management approval."}
{"text": "The three components of HSE-related drilling issues that are normally considered during drilling operations are discussed separately in the following sections."}
{"text": "4.13.1.1 Health\n\nHealth issues related to drilling operations can include industrial hygiene issues related to onsite conditions and may include exposures to drilling fluid components such as oil-base mud fumes and skin contact,highly toxic com- pletion brines,or oils,gas,and toxic materials such as hydrogen sulfide originating from the well.Naturally occur- ring radioactive materials (NORM)can also be encountered during workover operations,and metals such as mercury are encountered periodically in gas streams and may be found in production separators.An optimized drilling pro- gram includes careful consideration of the health impact on employees and workers at any well site."}
{"text": "It should be understood by all operation personnel that 96%of all accidents are related to unsafe behaviors and that only 4%of accidents are caused by unsafe conditions. Most drilling contractors have adopted policies that focus on encouraging safe behaviors."}
{"text": "Most companies have management systems in place for environmental management of their operations.Drilling personnel are responsible for planning and conducting oper- ations to ensure optimization and compliance."}
{"text": "4.13.2 Production Capacity\n\nProduction capacity requires investment.Performance mea- sures of optimization may include one or several of the following:days to pay out,cash flow,profit,finding cost (cost per barrel oil equivalent),and return on investment (ROD.The idea of diminishing returms plays a key role in the decision-making process.Delivering rate and reservoir volume carry associated cost and risks.Fundamental to drilling practices optimization is understanding how spe- cific cause-and-effect relationships influence this objective."}
{"text": "Key issues affecting production capability,which there- fore must receive a high priority when planning the drilling phase,include permeability(K)and porosity(Φ)of the zone of interest(ZOI.Formation damage resulting from poor planning may be permanent or very costly to correct. The right equipment,resources,knowledge,and skills are prerequisites for optimization."}
{"text": "Using a \"cradle to grave\"approach to well design considers the drilling phases and looks at all aspects of the well's life,from initial production through permanent abandonment [3].Close association is required between the multiple departments(e.g.,geology,asset management, drilling,completion,production)of the oil company and the service provider representatives.Communicating and sharing their respective areas of expertise and requirements with the others is paramount to optimization of the outcome."}
{"text": "New technologies can significantly enhance production capacity when properly applied and should not be for- gotten.Underbalanced drilling (UBD),expandable sand screens (ESS),expandable drilling liners (EDL),coiled- tubing drilling (CTD),hole enlarging devices (e.g.,bi- center drill bits,hole openers),casing drilling,and fiberoptic \"intelligent\"completions are a few examples."}
{"text": "Depending on the phase of planning and whether you are the operator or a service provider,some constraints will be out of your control to alter or influence(e.g.,casing point selection,casing sizes,mud weights,mud types,direc- tional plan,drilling approach such as BHA types or new technology use).There is significant value in being able to identify alternate possibilities for improvement over current methods,but well planning must consider future availability of products and services for possible well interventions. When presented properly to the groups affected by the change,it is possible to learn why it is not feasible or to alter the plan to cause improvement.Engineers must understand and identify the correct applications for technologies to reduce costs and increase effectiveness.A correct appli- cation understands the tradeoffs of risk versus reward and costs versus benefits."}
{"text": "Performance Measures\n\nCommon drilling optimization performance measures are cost per foot of hole drilled,cost per foot per casing interval, trouble time,trouble cost,and AFEs versus actual costs [6]."}
{"text": "Systems Approach\n\nDrilling requires the use of many separate pieces of equip- ment,but they must function as one system.The borehole should be included in the system thinking.The benefit is time reduction,safety improvement,and production increases as the result of less nonproductive time and faster drilling.For example,when an expected average rate of penetration(ROP)and a maximum instantaneous ROP have been identified,it is possible to ensure that the tools and borehole will be able to support that as a plan.Bit capabilities must be matched to the rpm,life,and formation. Downhole motors must provide the desired rpm and power at the flow rate being programmed.Pumps must be able to provide the flow rate and pressure as planned [7]."}
{"text": "When a trouble event leads to a fishing job,\"fishing economics\"should be performed.This can help eliminate emotional decisions that lead to overspending.Several factors should be taken in to account when determining whether to continue fishing or whether to start in the first place.The most important of these are replacement or lost- in-hole cost of tools and equipment,historical success rates (if known),and spread rate cost of daily operations.These can be used to determine a risk-weighted value of fishing versus the option to sidetrack."}
{"text": "2.Bit Life. Measures of bit life vary depending on bit type and application.Roller cones in soft to medium-soft rock often use KREVs (i.e.,total revolutions,stated in thousands of revolutions).This measure fails to consider the effect of WOB on bearing wear,but soft formations typically use medium to high rpm and low WOB;there- fore,this measure has become most common.Roller cones in medium to hard rock often use a multiplication of WOB and total revolutions,referred to as the WR or WN number,depending on bit vender.Roller cone bits smaller than 7gin.suffer significant reduction in bearing life,tooth life,tooth size,and ROP.PDC bits, impregnated bits,natural diamond bits,and TSP bits typically measure in terms if bit hours and KREVs. Life of all bits is severely reduced by vibration.Erosion can wear bit teeth or the bit face that holds the cutters, effectively reducing bit life."}
{"text": "3.Hole Cleaning. Annular velocity(AV)rules of thumb have been used to suggest hole-cleaning capacity,but each of several factors,including mud properties,rock properties,hole angle,and drill string rotation,must be considered.Directional drilling with steerable systems require\"sliding\"(not rotating)the drill string during the orienting stage;hole cleaning can suffer drasti- cally at hole angles greater than 50.Hole cleaning in large-diameter holes,even if vertical,is difficult merely because of the fast drilling formations and commonly low AV."}
{"text": "4.Rock Properties. It is fundamental to understand for- mation type,hardness,and characteristics as they relate to drilling and production.From a drilling perspective, breaking down and transporting rock(i.e.,hole cleaning) is required.Drilling mechanics must be matched to the rock mechanics.Bit companies can be supplied with electric logs and associated data so that drill bit types and operating parameters can be recommended that will match the rock mechanics.Facilitating maximum production capacity is given a higher priority through the production zones.This means drilling gage holes, minimizing formation damage (e.g.,clean mud,less exposure time),and facilitating effective cement jobs."}
{"text": "7.Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD).ECDs become critical when drilling in a soft formation environment where the fracture gradient is not much larger than the pore pressureControlling ROP,reducing pumping flow rate,drill pipe OD,and connection OD may all be considered or needed to safely drill the interval."}

The rig equipment (e.g.,pumps, liners,engines or motors,drill string,BHA)may be a given.In this case,optimizing the drilling plan based on its available capabilities will be required.However, if you can demonstrate or predict an improved oucome that would justify any incremental costs,then you will have accomplished additional optimization.The pumps cannot provide their rated horsepower if the engines providing power to the pumps possess inadequate mechanical horsepower.Engines must be down rated for efficiency.Changing pump liners is a simple cost- effective way to optimize the hydraulic system.Opti- mization involves several products and services and the personnel representatives.This increases the difficulty to achieve an optimized parameter selection that is best as a system."}
{"text": "2.Surface Stack Blowout Preventer (BOP).The use of a surface stack BOP configurations in floating drill- ing is performed by suspending the BOP stack above the waterline and using high-pressure risers (typically 133 in.casing)as a conduit to the sea floor.This method, generally used in benign and moderate environments, has saved considerable time and money in water depths to 6,000 ft [8]."}
{"text": "4.Rig Instrumentation.The efficient and effective appli- cation of weight to the bit and the control of downhole vibration play a key role in drilling efficiency.Excessive WOB applied can cause axial vibration,causing destruc- tive torsional vibrations.Casing handling systems and top drives are effective tools."}

Most bit venders are able to use the electric log data(Sonic,Gamma Ray,Resistivity as a minimum)and associated offset information to improve the selection of bit cutting structures.Formation type,hardness,and characteristics are evaluated and matched to the application needs as an optimization process [10,11]."}
{"text": "4.13.4 Drilling Implementation\n\nMost of the well drilling cost is time dependent rather than product cost dependent.Time is often the biggest influence. Rigs,boats,many tools,and personnel costs are charged as a function of time.Drilling mud is also discussed in terms of cost per day due to daily maintenance costs.The sum of the daily time-based costs is referred to as the operation's spread rate.In floater operations,the rig rate is the big influence.As spread rate increases,it becomes easier to economically justify higher-priced products that will save time.These may include more expensive bits,downhole turbines,rotary steerable systems,or a standard steerable system versus steering tools.The potential rewards of new technologies can be great."}
{"text": "4.13.4.1 Rate of Penetration\n\nIt is all about ROP,but how should we define ROP?Drilling optimization relies on minimizing total time.It is under- stood that we must be safe and must not damage production capacity.Our discussion focuses on drlling processes from spud to TD [12].First consider each casing interval and then identify any subinterval where a substantially different drilling process would be beneficial or required(e.g.,due to formation drillability or pressure changes,hole angle,mud type)and any planned events that would cause a trip.Where 1trips are required,an automatic opportunity is presented to change the drilling assembly and drilling approach or to replace the current tools with new ones if tool life may not be sufficient to reach the next planned trip point."}
{"text": "Discussing drilling\"time\"implies that the time is used to accomplish an outcome (i.e.,creating hole)—hence the concept and measure of ROP.There is more than one measure and definition of ROP.This can create misunder- standings,but there are needs for these various measures. ROP,as historically defined,includes the hours after a bit reaches bottomhole divided by the distance drilled until a decision is made to trip out of the hole.By this definition, ROPincludes the time spent actually drilling rock plus any back reaming,taking surveys with the steerable system,and making connections.It does not include time tripping in and out of the hole or circulating before tripping out."}
{"text": "Overall ROP(sometimes referred to as effective ROP) reflects the time to drill an entire interval,start to finish, divided by the distance drilled.This measure includes all time from start to finish,the rotating time,and the nonpro- ductive time,and it is of great importance to the drilling engineer and operator management.The interval may start at drill out and conclude with starting the trip out of the hole to run casing,or it may be a subinterval as defined in the planning stage."}

One advantage is that in one circulation the influx can be removed and the well killed (the Driller's method requires two circulations).Another advantage is that when the open hole section is long,lower shoe pressures will be exerted during the circulation.A major disadvantage is that it is significantly more complex when the drillstring is tapered and/or is a non-vertical well."}

{"text": "4.14.10 Subsea Considerations\n\nThe preceding discussion has focused on blowout preventer systems that are above ground or above the water in the case of offshore equipment.However,for wells drilled using subsea blowout preventers additional variables must be factored in.Procedurally,the biggest difference between a surface stack and a subsea stack when circulating out a kick is that in the case of the subsea stack the choke line friction pressure must be compensated for.If it is not compensated for then the bottom hole pressure will not be held constant when using the Driller's method or the Engineer's method as it should be and instead will be increased by the amount of friction pressure in the choke line.Compensation means that the casing pressure should be reduced by the amount of choke line friction as the pumps are brought up to speed. The greater the water depth then the greater the choke line friction for a given mud system."}

Under Gauge Borehole.Mud filter cake can build exces- sively across a low pressure permeable formation when the circulation rate is low,water loss is very high,and there is an extended period between trips.Under these conditions,a drill string or logging tools can become stuck in the under gauge borehole and/or filter cake. Filter cake build up is usually slow and appears as drag on the multi-channel recorder,or as an under gauge hole on a caliper survey."}
{"text": "3.Key seats.Key seats develop where there is a sudden change in hole deviation or above a washout in a devi- ated hole.Doglegs above the drill collars are subject to erosion or wear by the drill pipe on the high side of the dogleg.Continuous rotation can slowly cut a groove into the dogleg forming what is known as a key seat. The drill pipe body and tool joints wear a groove in the formation approximately the same diameter as the tool joints.The wear is confined to a narrow groove, because high tension in the drill pipe prevents side ways movement.During a trip out of the hole,the BHA may be pulled into these grooves and the grooves may be too small to allow the BHA to pass through.In this situation no attempt should be made to jar the collars through a key seat.A possible solution to this problem would be to circulate and rotate the drill string and move the string in small increments up through the key seat.All tight spots (over pull and depth of the over pull)should be noted and recorded on the IADC daily report and the drilling recorder.A tight spot that occurs on two successive trips out of the hole with over pull on the second trip greater than the first,is an indication of a key seat forming.A key seat wiper or string reamer should be run on the third trip."}

Except when the string can be pushed or pulled around the object or the object can be pushed into the wall of the hole,serious fishing problems can develop.This is especially true when the string gets jammed to one side of the hole in a cased hole.A visual check of all hand and other surface tools is required to see if anything is missing.Never leave the hole unprotected or leave loose objects lying around the rotary area.Jarring might free the string,if not,a short wash over is required using an internal spear to catch the string when it falls."}

{"text": "When working shallow without the benefit of a torque limit switch and if the string becomes stuck,the torque can build up very rapidly in the string and cause a twist off.If a work string is in poor condition a twist off can occur at any depth (with or without a torque limit switch).A twist off can be the most difficult type of fishing job due to the possible condition of the top of the fish.Turbulent flow of the circulating drilling fluid can damage a connection and cause a washout in the metal of the connection itself. If such a washout is not detected,the drill string can be weakened in the washed out area resulting in the failure of the string component.A washout in a tubular can in turn washout the formation.This would reduce the annular velocity in the washout area which in turn world diminish hole cleaning.Any time there is a drop in the standpipe pressure that cannot be explained,the string should be pulled immediately."}
{"text": "A string that alternately sticks then releases while drilling forward can result in a build up of torque which, when released,rotates the lower portion of the string at an accelerated rate.The inertia of the lower portion of the string can make the string back off.In a gauged area of the hole,the string could be screwed back together,but in a washed out area it will be necessary to run special tools to engage the fish.This can also occur off bottom while torque is in the string.Junk pushed into a soft formation can later damage tubulars rotating against the junk.It is always better to remove the junk than to push it to the side.Metal fatigue can cause a string to fail under normal operating parameters. Fatigue can be reduced by establishing the working life of string components and replacing them at the appropriate respective time intervals."}

{"text": "2.With this tension on the drill string,a reference mark is make on the drill string exposed at the top of the string."}
{"text": "There are four types of anchoring systems used in free point tools today.The oldest is the bow spring anchor This design has been in use since 1941.The others are the permanent magnet anchoring system,the electromagnet anchoring system,and the motorized anchoring system.All free point tools measure movement between the two anchors (average about 17/1000 of 1 in.in movement).All free point tools read movement between the two anchors in the form of tension on the pipe,compression on the pipe,right hand torque on the pipe,and the newest tools,including the read left hand torque.It is critical that both torque and stretch readings be measured and compared.If the two readings differ,the torque reading is generally more reliable\n\nThe interval between free pipe and stuck pipe is called the transition area.The interval is a length of the borehole. The length of the transition area is an important clue in helping to identify why the pipe is stuck.For example,in free pointing a stuck packer,the transition area would be extremely short if the pipe is free from the surface to the top of the packer.If the pipe were stuck due to fill on top of the packer,the transition are would be spread out over a longer interval.In an open hole a keyseat would result in a very short transition area while differential sticking would result in the transition area being spread out over a much longer interval.When parting the pipe it is important to leave some free pipe looking up(one or two joints of free pipe is recommended).Back-off at least 100 ft.below a casing seat or up inside the casing.Do not back-off in a washed out section or immediately below a drop in hole angle.Always make the back-off at the depth that will facilitate the best chance of future engagement to the fish."}

{"text": "4.15.3.1 Chemical Cut\n\nThe first chemical cutter was developed by McCullough Tool Company and used in the field in 1957.The chemical cutter is lowered inside the pipe(that is to be cut)to a depth of one or twojoints above the stuck point.A collar locator is used to correlate depths.Chemical cuts do not require that the pipe be torqued up.This affords a safer operation and is recommended in bad strings of pipe.Sometimes pipe will rotate freely,even though it cannot be pulled from the hole. This makes it impossible to back off the pipe.The chemical cutter utilizes heat energy to make a smooth cut without flare or distortion to the OD or ID of the pipe.It will not damage the outer string of casing or tubing making for easy engagement of the pipe being cut."}
{"text": "4.15.3.2 Jet Cutter\n\nThe shaped explosive charges using parabolic geometry were developed after World War I to penetrate thick steel armor.This shaped change was adapted to fit in casing or tubing and became production jet perforating changes that replaced the earlier bullet perforators.Further improve- ments in the technology allowed the shaped charge concept to be used in a 360°circle design that can be used to completely sever a steel tube.Advantages of the jet cutter are that the jet cutter does not have mechanical slips to set so the condition of the tubular being cut,or what the ID is coated with,has little bearing on the operation of the cut- ting.Jet cutters are shorter in length than a chemical cutter and greater size ranges are available.The disadvantage of a jet cutter is that the pipe being cut will be deformed and must be dressed off before fishing.Also,adjacent strings could be damaged."}

{"text": "4.15.3.7 Washover Back-off Safety Joint/Washover Procedures\n\nThe washover back-off safety joint is used to cross the wash pipe back to the jarring assembly and allow for washing over,screwing into a fish,and making a string shot back off in one trip.Should the washpipe become stuck,the washover safety joint provides a means to back off at the top of the washpipe with considerably less torque than is required to back off the work string.Due to the high risk of sticking the washpipe,a washover safety joint should be used any time a washover assembly is run in open hole.A fish can be screwed into with the washover safety joint,but several factors should be considered before this is done."}
{"text": "When the entire length of the washpipe had washed over the ish,the washpipe can be pulled from the hole and a jarring assembly run back to recover the fish.Special tools exist that allow the washing over,screwing in,and recovering of the fish in one trip.Use of these tools is very dependent on hole conditions and require a seasoned fishing tool operator.If the fish has been engaged but will not pull,a back-off should be made and the washover operation repeated to recover another section of the fish."}
{"text": "By providing an immediate bumping action these tools can help to free drill pipe,drill collars,bits and other tools that have become stuck,lodged or keyseated.To achieve a good impact with a bumper sub,the drill string stretch must be utilized to provide the speed for the impact.This requires dropping the drill or working string until the jar is approximately 50%closed;the string is stopped abruptly at the surface and the downward momentum continues down,supplying the impact.This is a delicate operation and requires a little practice.Another function of the bumper sub is to release engaging tools and provide a“soft touch”when attempting to get over the topof a fish.Whenever a releasing type of fishing tool is to be used,a bumper sub should be run just above it to aid in its release."}
{"text": "The fishing jaris a straight pull operated jar that employs elementary principles of hydraulics and mechanics.Fish- ing jars can be mechanically or hydraulically actuated. Hydraulic fishing jars are most common.Hydraulic jars require no setting or adjustments before going in the hole,or after the fish has been engaged.The intensity of the jarring blow may be controlled within a wide range of impact load applied by the amount of over pull applied to the string before the jar is tripped.As pull is applied to the jar,oil is forced from one side of the inner body to the other through some type of orifice slots that will meter volume of fluid into storage chambers.This allows for ample time to pull the required stretch in the string."}
{"text": "4.15.4.2 Fluid Accelerator or Intensifier\n\nDuring conventional jarring operations with either mechan- ical or hydraulic jars,the intensity of the blow struck is a function of,and proportional to the accelerated movement of the drill string above the jar.This accelerated movement will often be diminished by friction between the string and the wall of the hole.In such cases much of the energy will be lost.Also,at very shallow depths,lack of stretch in the running string causes significant loss in the effectiveness of the acceleration."}

{"text": "In open hole,the preferred method of engaging a fish is screwing in the with a screw in sub,joint of drill pipe,or a drill collar.This will meet all of the above requirements as well as providing the simplest and most fail safe means of solid engagement.Once screwed back together,the screw in point will have as high or higher mechanical properties as the fish below it.Screwing in will allow pump pressures equal to that of the string to be applied to the fish.Other than the jars,the ID of the string will not have changed after screwing in."}
{"text": "Screwing in is the preferred when down jars will be used due to the releasing mechanism of most engaging tools.

{"text": "4.15.7 Abandonment\n\nWell abandonment is a process to permanently shut-in a previously producing well in a safe and environmentally responsible way.This process is applied to both land and offshore wells.Obviously,offshore wells are the most complicated to permanently abandon.To abandon a well the casing is generally cut below the mud line.In the United States and its territorial waters,the depth below the mud line is defined in U.S.Federal Government regulations [6]. Other countries and regions of the world often use similar but different regulation sources.This type of operation was at one time the hardest perform.But with today's new recovery systems and new casing cutting technologies NPT has been greatly reduced,saving the operators thousands of dollars in rig time.Some companies have advanced wellhead recovery systems available on the market.An example of such tool systems is the Weatherford M.O.S.T."}

{"text": "Casing Program Design\n\nCasing program design is accomplished by two steps.In the first step,the casing sizes and corresponding bit sizes are determined.In the second step,the setting depths of the individual casing strings are evaluated."}
{"text": "Before starting the design,the production casing size and depth of the well are established by the petroleum engineer in cooperation with a geologist,so that the hole size (rock bit diameter)for the casing may be selected. Regarding the diameter of the hole,sufficient clearance beyond the coupling outside diameter should be provided to allow for mud cake and for a good cementing job.Field experience shows that the casing clearance should range from about 1.0 in.to 3.5in.Larger casing sizes require greater diametric clearance."}

Depending on the drilling fluid and formation,the more time spent drilling in open hole,the greater the possibility of formation caving or sloughing into the borehole.Formation instability may lead to expensive work in the borehole, which influences the time and cost of the drilling operation. To reduce this problem,special treatment drilling fluids might be used,but these special drilling fluids are expensive. Therefore,the casing and drilling fluid programs depend on each other,and solving the issue of correct casing setting depth evaluation is arather complicated optimization problem."}

{"text": "Example 4.16.3\n\nEvaluate an expected burst pressure acting on a surface casing string in exploratory drilling if the setting depth of the next string is 11,000ft."}
{"text": "Solution\n\nStep1. Internal pressure in the borehole.Because the next string is set at 11,000ft,the formation pore pressure gradi- ent is assumed to be 0.65 psi/ft.Thus,the bottomhole pres- sure(at a depth of 11,000ft)is(11,000)(0.65)=7,150 psi. Assume 50%evacuation;thus,(11,000)(0.5)=5,500 ft."}

{"text": "Step 2. External pressure.It is assumed that there is drilling fluid with specific gravity of 1.2 outside the casing.Thus,the external pressure at surface=0.0 psi and at 5,000ft is(5,000)(1.2)(8.34)(0.052)≌2,600 psi."}

{"text": "Step 1.Determine the lightest weight of casing to\n\nresist collapse pressure for a setting depth of 12,000 ft.Because the maximum collapse pressure is(12,000)(0.52)=6,240 psi,select N-80, 29-1b/ft casing with collapse resistance of 7,020 psi.(Note:assumed design factor for collapse=1.0.)This is Section 1."}

{"text": "In addition to primary cementing of the casing and liner, there are other important well cementing operations.These are squeeze cementing and plug cementing.Such operations are often called secondary or remedial cementing[2]."}
{"text": "Well cementing materials vary from basic Portland cement used in civil engineering construction of all types, to highly sophisticated special-purpose resin-based or latex cements.The purpose of all of these cementing materials is to provide the well driller with a fluid state slurry of cement, water and additives that can be pumped to specific locations within the well.Once the slurry has reached its intended location in the well and a setup time has elapsed,the slurry material can become a nearly impermeable,durable solid material capable of bonding to rock and steel casing."}
{"text": "The most widely used cements for well cementing are the Portland-type cements.The civil engineering construc- tion industry uses Portland cement and water slurries in conjunction with clean rock aggregate to form concrete. The composite material formed by the addition of rock aggregate forms a solid material that has a compressive strength that is significantly higher than the solid formed by the solidified cement and water slurry alone.The rock of the aggregate usually has a very high compressive strength (of the order of 5,000 to 20,000 psi).The cement itself will have a compressive strength of about 1,000 to 3,000 psi.Therefore,the rock of the aggregate forms a solid material that has a very high compressive strength of the order of 5,000 to 2,000 psi (345 to 1830bar).There- fore,the rock aggregate together with the matrix of solid cement can form a high-strength composite concrete with compressive strengths of the order of 4,000 to 15,000 (276 to 1035 bar)."}
{"text": "The well drilling industry does not generally use aggre- gate with the cement except for silica flour and Ottawa sand. This is mainly due to the tight spacing within a well that precludes the passage of the larger particles of aggregate through the system.Thus,the well drilling industry refers to this material as simply cement.The slurry pumped to wells is usually a slurry of cement and water with appropriate additives [1]."}
{"text": "4.17.2 Chemistry of Cements\n\nCement is made of calcareous and argillaceous rock mate- rials that are usually obtained from quarries.The process of making cement requires that these raw rock materials be ground,mixed and subjected to high temperatures."}

{"text": "In the dry process the limestone and clay materials are crushed and stored in separate bins and their composition analyzed.After the composition is known,the contents of the bins are blended to achieve the desired ultimate cement characteristics.The blend is ground to a mesh size of 100- 200.This small mesh size maximizes the contact between individual particles."}
{"text": "After the blends have been prepared (either in the dry or wet process),these materials are fed at a uniform rate into a long rotary kiln.The materials are gradually heated to a liquid state.At temperatures up to about 1,600°F the free water evaporates,the clay minerals dehydroxylate and crystallize,and CaCO₃decomposes.At temperatures up to about 1600°F(870℃)the CaCO₃and CaO react with aluminosilicates and the materials become liquids.Heating is continued to as high as 2800°F(1540℃)."}
{"text": "When the kiln material is cooled it forms into crystal- lized clinkers.These are rather large irregular pieces of the solidified cement material.These clinkers are ground and a small amount of gypsum is added(usually about 1.5 to 3%). The gypsum prevents flash setting of the cement and also controls free CaO.This final cement product is sampled, analyzed and stored.The actual commercial cement is usually a blend of several different cements.This blending ensures a consistent product."}

{"text": "Tricalcium aluminate(3CaO●Al₂O₃)hydrates rapidly and contributes most to heat of hydration.This com- pound does not contribute greatly to the final strength of the set cement,but it sets rapidly and plays an important role in the early strength development.This setting time can be controlled by the addition of gypsum The final hydrated product of tricalcium aluminate is readily attacked by sulfate waters.High-sulfate-resistant (HSR)cements have only a 3%or less content of this compound.High early strength cements have up to 15% of this compound."}
{"text": "Tricalcium silicate(3CaO●SiO₂)is the major contribu- tor to strength at all stages,but particularly during early stages of curing(up to 28 days).The average tricalcium silicate content is from 40%to maximum of 67%.The retared cements will contain from40%to 45%.The high early strength cements will contain 60%to 67%."}
{"text": "Dicalcium silicate(2CaO●SiO₂)is very important in the final strength of the cement.This compound hydrates very slowly.The average dicalcium silicate content is 25%to 35%."}
{"text": "Tetracalcium aluminoferrite(4CaO●Al₂O₃●FeO₃)has little effect on the physical properties of the cement. For high-sulfate-resistant(HSR)cements,API specifi- cations require that the sum of the tetracalcium alumino- ferrite content plus twice the tricaclium aluminate may not exceed a maximum of 24%."}
{"text": "magnesia,free lime and other components.These do not significantly affect the properties of the set cement,but they can influence rates of hydration,resistance to chemical attack and slurry properties."}
{"text": "When the water is added to the final dry cement mate- rial,the hydration of the cement begins immediately.The water is combined chemically with the cement material to eventually form a new immobile solid.As the cement hydrates,it will bond to the surrounding surfaces.This cement bonding is complex and depends on the type of surface to be cemented.Cement bonds to rock by a process of crystal growth.Cement bonds to the outside of a casing by filling in the pit spaces in the casing body [4]."}
{"text": "4.17.3 Cementing Principles\n\nThere are two basic oil well cementing activities:primary cementing and secondary cementing."}
{"text": "● Surface casing string must be cemented to protect fresh- water formations near the surface and provide a struc- tural connection between the casing and the subsurface competent rock formations.This subsurface structural connection will allow the blowout preventor to be affixed to the top of this casing to prevent high-pressure fluids from being vented to the surface.Further,this structural connection will give support for deeper run casing or liner strings."}
{"text": "● Intermediate casing strings are cemented to seal off abnormal pressure formations and cover both incompe- tent formations,which could cave or slough,and lost circulation formations."}
{"text": "● Production casing string is cemented to prevent the produced fluids from migrating to nonproducing forma- tions and to exclude other fluids from the producing interval."}
{"text": "The proper amount of water must be mixed with the dry cement product to ensure only sufficient water for hydration of the cement.Excess water above that needed for hydration will reduce the final strength of the set cement and leave voids in the cement column that are filled with unset liquid. Insufficient water for proper hydration will leave a slurry too viscous to pump."}
{"text": "The cement is usually dry mixed with the additives that are usually added for a particular cementing application. Often this mixing of additives is carried out at the service company central location.Depending on the application of the well cement,there are a variety of additives that can be used to design the cement slurry characteristics.These are accelerators,retarders,dispersants,extenders,weighting agents,gels,foamers and fluid-loss additives.With these additives the cement slurry and ultimately the set cement can be designed for the particular cementing operation.It is necessary that the engineer in charge of the well carry out the necessary engineering design of the slurries to be used in the well.In addition,the engineer should ensure that the work is carried out in accordance to the design specifications.This critical activity should not be left to the service company technicians."}

{"text": "The ASTM specifications provide for five types of Portland cements:Types I,IⅡ,Ⅲ,IV and V;they are manufactured for use at atmospheric conditions [6].The API Classes A,B and C correspond to ASTM Types I,Ⅱ and Ⅲ,respectively.The API Classes D,E,F,G,H and J are cements manufactured for use in deep wells and to be subject to a wide range of pressures and temperatures.These classes have no corresponding ASTM types."}
{"text": "Sulfate resistance is an extremely important property of well cements.Sulfate minerals are abundant in some under- ground formation waters that can come into contact with set cement.The sulfate chemicals,which include magnesium and sodium sulfates,react with the lime in the set cement to form magnesium hydroxide,sodium hydroxide and cal- cium sulfate.The calcium sulfate reacts with the tricalcium aluminate components of cement to form sulfoaluminate, which causes expansion and ultimately disintegrates to the set cement.To increase the resistance of a cement to sulfate attack,the amount of tricalcium aluminate and free lime in the cement should be decreased.Altermatively,the amount of pozzolanic material can be increased in the cement to obtain a similar resistance.The designations of ordinary sul- fate resistance,moderate sulfate resistance and high sulfate resistance in the cement classes above indicate decreasing amounts oftricalcium aluminate."}
{"text": "The maximum amount of water for any class of cement is usually defined as the ratio that results in the cement particles remaining in suspension until the initial set of the slurry has taken place.If more than the maximum amount of water is used,then the cement particles will settle in such a manner that there will be pockets of free water within the set cement column."}

{"text": "4.17.5.2 Thickening Time\n\nIt is important that the thickening time to be known prior to using the slurry in a cementing operation.When water is added to dry cement and its additives,a chemical reaction begins that results in an increase in slurry viscosity.This viscosity increases over time,which will vary in accordance with the class of cement used,the additives placed in the dry cement prior to mixing with water and the temperature and confining pressure in the location where the cement slurry is placed.When the viscosity becomes too high,the slurry is no longer pumpable.Thus,if the slurry has not been placed in its proper location within the well prior to the cement slurry becoming unpumpable,the well and the surface equipment would be seriously damaged."}
{"text": "Thickening time Tt(hr)is defined as the time required for the cement slurry to reach the limit of 100 Bearden units of consistency.3³This thickening time must be considerably longer than the time necessary to carry out the actual cementing operation.This can be accomplished by choosing the class of cement that has a sufficiently long thickening time,or placing the appropriate additives in the slurry that will retard the slurry chemical reaction and lengthen the thickening time."}
{"text": "It is necessary that an accurate estimate of the total time be for the actual operation.A safety factor should be added to this estimate.Usually this safety factor is from 30min (for shallow operations)to as long as 2hr(for deep complex operations)."}
{"text": "The cement slurry thickening time can be increased or decreased by adding special chemicals to the dry cement prior to mixing with water.Retarders are added to increase the thickening time and thus increase the time when the cement slurry sets.Some common retarders are organic compounds such as lignosulphonate,cellulose derivatives, sugar derivativess and synthetics.Accelerators are added to decrease the thickening time and thus decrease the time when the cement slurry sets.Accelerators are often used when it is required to have the cement obtain and early compressive strength,usually of the order of 500 psi (35bar).Early setting cement slurries are used to cement surface casing strings or directional drilling plugs where waiting-on-cementing(WOC)must be kept to a minimum."}
{"text": "The most common accelerators are calcium chloride to a lesser extent sodium chloride\n\nIn general the thickening time for all neat cement slurries of all classes of cement will decrease significantly with increasing well environment temperature and/or confining pressure.Thus it is very important that the well extreme temperatures and confining pressures be defined for a par- ticular cementing operation before the cement slurry is designed.Once the well temperature and pressure condi- tions are known,either from offset wells or from actual well logs during the drilling operation,and the estimated cement- ing operation time is known,the cement slurry with the required thickening time can be designed.After the initial cement slurry design has been made it is usually necessary to carry out laboratory tests to verify that the actual cement batch mix used will give the required thickening time(and other characteristics needed).Such tests are usually carried out by the cementing service company laboratory using the operator's specifications."}
{"text": "The mixing time is obtained from Equation 4.17.5."}
{"text": "4.17.5.3 Strength of Set Cement\n\nA properly designed cement slurry will set after it has been placed in its appropriate location within the well.Cement strength is the strength the set cement has obtained.This usually refers to compressive strength,but can also refer to tensile strength.Cement having a compressive strength of 500 psi(35 bar)is considered adequate for most well applications."}
{"text": "The compressive strength of set cement is dependent upon the water-to-cement ratio used in the slurry,curing time,the temperature during curing,the confining pressure during curing and the additives in the cement.As part of the cement design procedures,samples of the cement slurry to be used in the cementing operation are cured and compression strength tested and often shear bond strength tested.These tests are usually carried out by the cementing company laboratory at the request of the operator."}
{"text": "l=length of the cement column in in."}
{"text": "Atcuring temperatures of about 230°F(93℃)or greater, the compressive strength of nearly all classes of cement cured under pressure will decrease.This decrease in com- pressive strength is often denoted as strength retrogres- sion.An increase in cement permeability accompanies this decrease in strength.This strength retrogression problem can be solved by adding from 30 to 50%(by weight) of silica flour or silica sand to the cement slurry.This silica additive prevents the strength retrogression and the corresponding increase in permeability of the cement."}
{"text": "The most common low-specific-gravity solids used to reduce cement slurry specific weight are bentonite,diatoma- ceous earth,solid hydrocarbons,expanded perlite and poz- zolan.It may not be possible to reduce the cement slurry specific weight enough with the above low-specific-weight materials when very weak formations are exposed.In such cases nitrogen is used to aerate the mud column above the cement slurry to assist in further decreasing the hydrostatic pressure."}

Hematite requires the addition of some water when it is used as an additive.Hematite has minimal effect on thickening time and compressive strength of the cement."}
{"text": "Ilmenite. This additive has a specific gravity of about 4.67. It is a mineral composed of iron,titanium and oxygen.It requires no additional water to be added to the slurry;thus, it can yield slurry specific weights as high as the hematite additive.Imenite also has mineral effect on thickening time and compressive strength of the cement."}

{"text": "For example,when cementing a casing string run to shallow depth or when setting a directional drilling kick- off plug,it is necessary to accelerate the cement hydration so that the waiting period will be minimized.The most commonly used cement hydration accelerators are calcium chloride,sodium chloride,a hemihydrate form of gypsum and sodium silicate."}
{"text": "Sodium Silicate. When diatomaceous earth is used with the cement slurry,sodium silicate is used as the accelerator.It can be used in concentrations up to 7%by weight."}
{"text": "When it is necessary to cement casing or line strings set at great depths,additives are often used in the design of the cement slurry to retard the thickening and setting time.Usually such retarding additives are organic com- pounds.These materials are also referred to as thinners or dispersants.Calcium lignosulfonate is one of the most commonly used cement retarders.It is very effective at increasing thickening and setting time in cement slurries at very low concentrations (of the order of 1%by weight or less).It is necessary to add an organic acid to the calcium lignosulfonate when high-temperature conditions are encountered."}
{"text": "Calcium-sodium lignosulfonate is a better retarding additive when high concentrations of bentonite are to be used in the design of the cement slurry."}

{"text": "4.17.6.4 Viscosity Control\n\nThe viscosity of the cement slurry will affect the pumping requirements for the slurry and frictional pressure gradient within the well.The viscosity must be kept low enough to ensure that the cement slurry can be pumped to the well during the entire cementing operation period.High viscosity will result in high-pressure gradients that could allow formation fractures."}
{"text": "Examples of commonly used viscosity control additives are calcium lignosulfonate,sodium chloride and some long- chain polymers.These additives also act as accelerators or retarders so care must be taken in designing the cement slurry with these materials."}

{"text": "The running of long casing strings and liner strings to great depths and successfully cementing these strings required careful engineering design and planning."}
{"text": "Prior to running the casing string into the wellthe mill varnish should be removed from the outer surface of the casing.The removal of the mill varnish is necessary to ensure that the cement will bond to the steel surface."}
{"text": "casing is nearly centered in the borehole,thus allowing a more uniform distribution of cement slurry flow around the casing.This nearly uniform flow around the casing is necessary to remove the drilling mud in the annulus and provide an effective seal."}
{"text": "centralizers are generally run when casing is being run through a restricted bore hole,into under reamed sections, or into washed out zones.Rigid centralizers perform best when the well internal diameter is constant."}
{"text": "The casing string is lowered into the drilling mud in the well using the rig drawworks and elevators.The displaced drilling mud flows to the mud tanks and is stored there for later use.Once the entire casing string is in place in the borehole,the casing string is left hanging in the elevators through the cementing operation.This allows the casing string to be reciprocated(moved up and down)and possibly rotated as the cement is placed in the annulus.This movement assists the removal of the drilling mud."}
{"text": "Usually a lighter drilling mud is used to follow the heavy cement slurry.In this way the casing is under compression from a higher differential pressure on the outside of the cas- ing.Thus when the cement sets and drilling or production operations continues,the casing will always have an elastic load on the cement-casing interface.This elastic load is considered essential for maintenance of the cement-casing bond and to keep leakage between the cement and casing (i.e.,the microannulus)from occurring."}
{"text": "The basic steps for the planning and execution of a successful cementing operation are:\n\n1.Condition the well and the drilling mud prior to pulling the drill pipe.Typically at least one hole volume is circulated to remove cutting and debris."}

{"text": "4.An injectivity test is performed using clean,solids-free water or brine.If a low fluid loss completion fluid is in the hole,it must be displaced from the perforations before starting the injecting.This test will give an idea of the permeability of the formation to the cement filtrate."}
{"text": "1.[] If tail pipe is run,the minimum distance between perforations and packer is limited to the length of the tail pipe.The packer must not be set too close to the perforations as pressure communication through the annulus above the packer might cause the casing to collapse.A safe setting depth must be decided on after seeing the logged quality of the cement bond.

{"text": "6.Squeeze pressure is applied at the surface.If high- pressure squeezing is practiced,the formation is broken down and the cement slurry pumped into the frac- tures before the hesitation technique is applied.If low- pressure squeezing is desired,hesitation is started as soon as the packer is set."}
{"text": "7.Hesitation continues until no pressure leak-off is observed.A further test of about 500 psi(35bar)over the final injection pressure will indicate the end of the injection process.Usually,well-cementing perforations willtolerate pressures above the formation fracture pres- sure,but the risk of fracturing is increased."}
{"text": "8.Pressure is released and returns are checked.If no returns are noticed,the packer by-pass is opened and excess cement reversed out.Washing off cement in front of perforations can be performed by releasing the packer and slowly lowering the work string during the reversing."}
{"text": "There are two methods for placing cement plugs."}
{"text": "1.Balance plug method is the most commonly used.The cement slurry is placed at the desired depth through the drillpipe or tubing run to that depth.A spacer is placed below and above the slurry plug to avoid contamination of the cement slurry with surrounding drilling mud and to assist in balancing the mud.There are a number of tools available in the market to assist in plug balancing. Most involve drill pipe darts that provide a means of sep- arating fluids,wiping the pipe and provide an indication of the end of displacement."}

{"text": "Tubing string design is much the same as for casing."}
{"text": "For shallow and moderately deep holes,uniform strings are preferable;however,in deep wells,a tapered tubing can be desirable.A design factor for tension should be about 1.4-1.6.The collapse design factor must not be less than 1.0,assuming an annulus filled up with fluid and evacuated tubing.The design factor for burst should not be less than 1.1."}
{"text": "Two approaches can be used to handle tubing move- ment:\n\n1.Provide seals of sufficient length."}
{"text": "2.Slack off enough weight of tubing to prevent movement."}
{"text": "4.18.2 Packers\n\nA packer is simply a mechanical means of forming a seal between two strings of pipe or between the pipe and the open hole.This generated seal isolates the tubing from the casing or open hole,preventing vertical flow of fluids."}
{"text": "To qualify as a packer,a tool needs only a sealing means and a method of maintaining an opening through the middle.Typically,most packers available today incorporate the following components in their design."}
{"text": "Setting mechanism which initiates the setting sequence when desired during installation."}
{"text": "Typically,packers are identified by their classification (permanent or retrievable),application (production or ser- vice),and setting method (mechanical,hydraulic,hydro- static or wireline)."}
{"text": "Permanent packers do not have releasing mechanisms and are not retrievable from surface.When a permanent packer is set,the tubing can be removed from the well without releasing the packer.Permanent packers can only be removed by destroying their integrity through milling or drilling."}
{"text": "Retrievable packers are an integral part of the tubing string.The packer is set,released and pulled with the tubing string.The tubing string cannot be removed from the well bore without pulling the packer unless an on/off tool or similar mechanism is used with the packer."}
{"text": "Production packers are designed to meet general or specific well conditions and provide a long operational life in those conditions.They are manufactured from a variety of materials to meet operational life expectancy in different environments.Production packers are used for a number of reasons,which can be summarized into four categories,which are:protecting the casing string,maxi- mum safety and control,energy conservation,and improve productivity."}
{"text": "4.18.2.1 Protecting the Casing\n\nSince the casing string is cemented in the hole,it is consid- ered permanent and non-replaceable.A string of replaceable tubing is normally run inside the casing to control and provide the conduit necessary to bring the producible fluids to the surface."}
{"text": "Damaged tubing is relatively easy to remedy as it can be pulled and replaced.Damage to the casing,on the other hand,creates a serious problem,which jeopardize the productivity of the well.Casing is difficult and expensive to repair."}
{"text": "Where a packer is not used,the casing is exposed to produced fluids,which are often corrosive.In order to maintain a controlled inhibited atmosphere,a packer is necessary to seal the bottom of the casing,which prevents the release of produced fluids into the tubing annulus."}
{"text": "The casing may also be exposed to pressure differentials high enough to cause casing damage.The tubing string normally has higher-pressure ratings than the casing.Using a packer to seal the tubing annulus above the produc- tive zone will confine the high differentials to the tubing string."}
{"text": "During completion operations,the packer can be used as a plug to completely shut off the production zone while work is being done up the hole,or during nippling up operations.High-pressure zones can be tested or produced without exposing the casing or wellhead equipment to unnecessary high pressures."}
{"text": "During producing operations,the packer confines high pressures to the tubing string where they are more eas- ily controlled.Safety shut-in devices and other accessory equipment are often installed in the tubing for maximum control."}
{"text": "4.18.2.3 Energy Conservation\n\nOne of the primary reasons for using a smaller tubing string to produce the formation fluids is to maintain sufficient velocity to take full advantage of available energy.With high velocities,oil,water and gas are intermingled so that the gas energy is used,preventing the heavier water from falling back and killing the well."}
{"text": "When a packer is not used,gas tends to break out into the tubing annulus,accumulating at the top of the casing. This results in a loss of energy.A packer funnels all of the production into the tubing string,so all of the available gas energy is utilized to lift the fluid."}
{"text": "If two different zones are perforated,interflow between the zones results in a loss of energy for the more pro- lific zone.Formation damage and/or loss of hydrocarbon reserves can also result from this uncontrolled formation flow."}
{"text": "4.18.2.4 Improve Productivity\n\nA packer allows the casing to be used as an energy storage area and/or conduit in artificial lift operations;such as,gas lift and hydraulic pumping."}
{"text": "Sealing between two zones allows both to be produced simultaneously with maximum control by using two strings of tubing."}
{"text": "In some cases,it is desirable to perforate a second zone for production at a later date.To keep this alternate zone isolated from the producing zone,a packer is set between the two.With the proper equipment,the zones can be switched without pulling the tubing string."}
{"text": "In a mechanical set application,tubing movement is used to create the force necessary to set the packer and energize the element."}
{"text": "In a hydraulic set application,a force is generated inter- nally within the packer by applying fluid pressure against a plug to set the slips and energize the element."}
{"text": "In a hydrostatic set application,a setting force is gener- ated by applying fluid pressure to both the inside and outside of the tubing to set the slips and energize the element."}
{"text": "For wireline set applications,an electric wireline pres- sure setting tool is used.An electric current ignites a powder charge to create a gas pressure within the setting tool.The gas pressure then acts on a hydraulic piston to create a force sufficient to set the packer slips,energize the element and shear the setting tool from the packer."}
{"text": "Choosing and successfully installing the best packer for a job depends on the proper evaluation and analysis of the forces that may act on the tubing and the packer during the lifetime of the installation.The effect of the forces can only be determined by an accurate force analysis.The installation can proceed with a high degree of confidence if no detrimental effects are shown during analysis.However, if analysis indicates that damage to the tubing or packer could occur,reassessment and revision of the installation procedures will reduce the risk of costly recovery."}
{"text": "The anticipated change in well conditions that may occur after the packer has been set must be analyzed to evaluate the forces affecting the packer and tubing string."}
{"text": "Temperature and pressure variations occur within the well throughout its lifecycle.Changes in these conditions can lead to a change in length of the tubing string or a change in force throughout the tubing string depending on the type of packer chosen and the packer to tubing configuration.The tubing will either lengthen or shorten when temperature,tubing pressure or annulus pressure is changed in the well.If the tubing is anchored,the change in force will occur at the packer as well as over the entire length of the tubing string.If the tubing is free to move,the tubing string will experience a net change in length."}
{"text": "In permanent packer installations,pressure changes that occur inside the tubing act on the difference in areas between the seal bore(packer valve,Ap)and the tubing ID area(Ai).Pressure changes that occur in the annulus act on the difference in areas between the seal bore(packer valve, Ap)and the tubing OD area(A₀)."}
{"text": "The result of the piston effect is either an up or down force on the tubing at the packer.Upward forces are des- ignated as negative(-)forces,and downward forces are designated as positive(+)forces."}
{"text": "In\"anchored\"installations (the tubing is not allowed to move),the piston effect leads to a change in force either upward (compression)or downward (tension)at the packer.Upward forces are designated as negative(-),and downward forces are designated as positive(+)."}
{"text": "In \"free\"installations (the tubing-to-packer configura- tion allows movement of the tubing),the piston effect leads to a change in length either upward (shortening)or downward (lengthening)of the tubing string."}
{"text": "In retrievable packer installations where the tubing is attached to the packer via a coupling on the packer mandrel, the piston effect will always result in a force change on the packer.The resulting force change will either be a change in tubing compression,or a change in tubing tension unless an expansion joint is installed in the tubing string above the packer."}
{"text": "If the tubing pressure is greater than the annular pres- sure,the affected area is calculated on the knife seal OD.If the annular pressure is greater than the tubing pressure,the affected area is calculated on the knife seal ID."}
{"text": "When the packer and tubing string are installed in the well,the hydrostatic pressure in the well acts on the end area of the tubing string.This creates an upward,pressure- related effect,resulting in a reduction in the weight of the tubing string as well as a shortening of the overall length of the tubing string.This effect is known as force due to buoyancy or the buoyancy effect.Although the tubing is shortened as a result of the buoyancy effect,the packer-to- tubing relationship is not affected until the packer is set. Once the packer is set and the packer valve is closed,a change in pressure in either the tubing or the annulus will result in a change in the tubing force at the packer,and will affect the tubing-to-packer relation."}
{"text": "When calculating the piston effect,always consider the tubing-to-packer relation as \"balanced\"when the packer is set.Any changes in well condition that occur after the packer is set will affect the packer-to-tubing relation."}
{"text": "When calculating the force due to the piston effect,it is the change in pressure rather than the absolute pressure that is important.To determine this,both initial and final well conditions need to be known.The initial conditions\n\nare those that existed when the packer was set,or when the seal assembly was stung into the packer sealbore.Final conditions are those conditions that are to be expected during production,stimulation,or well work-overs [4]."}
{"text": "L=Length of the tubing string,in."}
{"text": "F1=Force change due to Piston Effect,Ibs."}
{"text": "A mechanically applied compressive force acting on the end area of the tubing will cause tubing to buckle. When compressive force is applied to a tubing string that is, essentially,relatively flexible,the tubing will bow outward or will buckle.For example,tubing that is standing in a derrick willbuckle or bow outward due to its own weight."}
{"text": "Buckling will only shorten a tubing string.Pressure buckling will only exert a negligible change in force on a packer and will only occur if the final pressure within the tubing string is greater than the final pressure outside the\n\ntubing string."}
{"text": "It should be noted that pressure buckling can occur in a tubing string even if the tubing is in tension throughout its entire length.Although in tension and considered as being in a\"straight\"condition within the wellbore,the tubing string will buckle due to the effect of pressure on buckling."}
{"text": "Tubing buckling is most severe at the bottom of the tubing string where the pressure is the greatest.It lessens further up the hole until,normally,a point is reached where tubing buckling does not occur.This point is known as the neutral point.The tubing below the neutral point is buckled, while the tubing above remains straight."}
{"text": "The factors that have the most influence on the amount of tubing buckling that will occur are the radial clearance (r)between the tubing OD and the casing ID,the magnitude of the pressure differential from the tubing ID to the tubing OD,and the size of the packer valve.Because these factors have a direct effect on buckling,as any one of these factors increases,the length change due to buckling will increase."}

{"text": "△L2=Length change due to buckling,in. L=Length of the tubing string,in."}
{"text": "If the pressure differential exists on the outside of the tubing string,the tubing tries to contract radically and,it lengthens if it is free to move.If the tubing is not free to move,it will create a compressive force.This lengthening of the tubing string due to external pressure change is referred to as reverse ballooning."}
{"text": "The ballooning effect is directly proportional to the area over which the pressure is acting,and as a result,the effect of reverse ballooning is slightly greater than that of ballooning."}
{"text": "Unlike the piston and buckling effects,the ballooning effect occurs over the entire length of the tubing string. Ballooning effect calculations are based on changes in the average pressures inside and outside the tubing."}
{"text": "The average pressure is based on the half the sum of the surface pressure plus the pressure at the packer.Increasing the bottom hole pressure,by changing the fluid gradient would have half the effect of making the same change by applying added surface pressure."}
{"text": "Well conditions can affect the average pressure inside and outside the tubing:The effects due to ballooning and reverse ballooning are calculated together,then the net effect is expressed as either a positive force (ballooning), or a negative force(reverse ballooning),or change in length of the tubing string,depending on the tubing string's ability to move at the packer."}
{"text": "2.Pressure calculations are based on changes in the surface tubing or casing pressure(applied)and changes in fluid density(hydrostatic)."}
{"text": "The basic principles of expansion and contraction apply when the average temperature of the tubing string is increased or decreased.When the average temperature of the tubing is decreased by injecting cool fluids,the tubing string will shorten in length if it is free to move.If the tubing string is not free to move,then a tension force will be created."}
{"text": "When the average temperature of the tubing string is increased either by injecting warm fluids,or by producing warm oil and/or gas,the tubing will lengthen,or elongate, if it is free to move.If the tubing is not free to move,a compressive force on the packer will result,caused by the increase in the average tubing temperature.In many packer installations,the temperature effect willbe the largest of the four basic effects."}
{"text": "Because the temperature change in a tubing string occurs over the entire length of the tubing string,the change in average tubing temperature must be calculated to determine the resulting change in force or length."}

{"text": "In packer installations that do not permit movement of the tubing,the degree and direction of the tubing force change expected (total effect)must be determined after considering the four basic effects independently,then collectively."}
{"text": "The total effect is then determined by adding together each basic effect and any mechanically applied effect and can be expressed mathematically."}

{"text": "△L=Length change of the tubing due to tension force,in."}
{"text": "When determining length changes of the tubing in an installation where the tubing is stung through the packer, there will always be a change (△Ltotal)in the total length of the tubing string if a change in pressure or temperature occurs,and this change must be calculated."}
{"text": "Example 4.18.1\n\nCalculate the expected movement of tubing under condi- tions as specified below.Initially both tubing and annulus are filled with a crude of 30°API.Thereafter,the crude in the tubing is replaced by a 15-1b/gal cement slurry to perform a squeeze cementing operation.While the squeeze cementing job is performed,pressures pi=5,000 psi and Po=1,000 psi are applied at the surface on the tubing and annulus respectively."}

{"text": "The total expected tubing movement is\n\n△L₆=△L₁+△L₂+△L₃+△L₄=-165.48in."}
{"text": "In a packer installation where the tubing is landed on the packer and the change in total length(△Ltotal)calculated is a downward movement (a positive value),the total length change will not occur due to the tubing being restrained from downward movement because of its landed configu- ration.The change in tubing length will result in a change in force(compressive)on the packer."}
{"text": "If the tubing is in a landed condition and the total change in length(△Ltotal)calculated is an upward movement(a negative value),the tubing is not restrained and is free to move upward."}
{"text": "If the tubing is latched to the packer,the total length change(△Ltotal)will bezero because the tubing is restrained from upward or downward movement and compressive or tension forces will result.In such instances the solutions for the tubing force and tubing-to-packer force are best left to computer software.Even a minor bit of complexity in the tubing configuration can render the solution trial-and error\n\nWhen determining force changes in the tubing string in an installation where the tubing is stung through the packer,the tubing-to-packer force(Fp)will always equal zero because the tubing can never exert a force on the packer."}

{"text": "Pitting corrosion occurs in two stages,pit initiation and pit growth.There have been numerous studies on pitting corrosion[15-17].The initiation stage has been reported by Gellings [3]to usually be on the order of several months."}
{"text": "Corrosion pits vary in size,depth and frequency.The shape (size and depth)of pits have been quantified by measurements of the ratio of the depth to the width.A pitting factor is sometimes defined as the ratio of the deepest pit depth to the average pit depth[9],this is presented in the next equation."}
{"text": "From the environmental details,it has been noted that chloride ions and oxidizing agents such as Cu+2and Fe+3 salts frequently are associated with pitting.It is also known that hydroxides,chromates and silicates often inhibit the formation of pitting [3]."}

{"text": "hat differs greatly from the remainder of the drill pipe structure.This localized condition is more anodic and more susceptible to corrosion attack."}
{"text": "For most metals there is a critical temperature below which pitting does not occur.This temperature is dependent on the material composition and the specific environment. For stainless steels,the critical pitting temperature is related to the PREN number as expressed earlier."}
{"text": "This condition occurs in a narrow band that corrodes preferentially."}
{"text": "4.19.2.4 Crevice Corrosion\n\nCrevice corrosion is a form of localized corrosion attack where the corrosion takes place between adjoining surfaces such as made-up threaded and flanged connections,beneath metal banding and thread protectors,and even beneath scale and corrosion deposits.This type of localized corrosion occurs very similarly to pitting corrosion except that the geometric effects of the crevice influence the initiation and propagation of the attack."}
{"text": "Crevice corrosion is differentiated from pitting corrosion in that the initiation phase is different [20].Localized vari- ations in the environment cause potential differences and result in local breakdown of passive films and accelerated corrosion.Crevice corrosion has been related to differences in oxygen content commonly known as differential aeration by Gelling [3]and Trethewey and Chamberlain [20].Oxy- gen is consumed within the crevice during even low levels of corrosion and the oxygen becomes depleted because the crevice geometry prevents bulk fluid transfer into the crevice(this is a stagnant condition)."}
{"text": "In itself,the depleted oxygen does not cause corrosion."}
{"text": "Inside the crevice,when even low levels of corrosion occur, there is a corresponding increase in dissolved metal ions and chloride ions (in chloride containing environments). These local changes in the environment result in a decrease in the pH locally thus increasing the aggressiveness of the environment with respect of corrosion.These local changes in the environment cause increased corrosion rates and, since the oxygen is depleted,the damaged surface oxide films providing corrosion protection do not reform or are very sluggish to form.This further accelerates the localized corrosion."}
{"text": "Crevice corrosion can be avoided or minimized primar- ily by changing the geometry(first choice)or by selecting a material that is more resistant to corrosion in the intended environment.The material factors that increase a metal's resistance to pitting corrosion are essentially identical to those factors that increase resistance to crevice corrosion. This means that the equations defined in the discussion on pitting corrosion also apply to crevice corrosion."}
{"text": "The temperature factor in pitting corrosion also has a corollary in crevice corrosion.An increase in temperature results in an increased probability of the occurrence of crevice corrosion.There is also a temperature below which the likelihood of crevice corrosion is very low."}
{"text": "The factors affecting gal vanic corrosion are related to material and geometry.To predict galvanic corrosion,these two areas need to be examined."}
{"text": "corrosion:\n\n1.Use welded butt joints instead of riveted or bolted joints in new equipment.Sound welds and complete penetra- tion are necessary to avoid introducing an additional crevice source."}
{"text": "2.Close crevices by using continuous welds,caulk,braze, solder or paint."}
{"text": "3.Avoid stagnant areas and design for complete drainage."}
{"text": "4.Remove scale and other deposits.Remove solids to prevent deposit formation,a source of crevices."}
{"text": "5.Remove wet packing materials during long shutdowns."}
{"text": "6.Provide as uniform an environment as possible such as using backfill materials in pipeline trenching."}
{"text": "7.Weld instead rolling in tubes in tube sheets."}
{"text": "In geometric effects,the three factors are relative sur- face areas,distance between the different materials and shape effects.The greater the ratio of cathodic(more noble)to anodic (less noble)surface area,the greater the likelihood that galvanic corrosion will occur.The driving force here is the increasing anodic current den- sity with greater ratios resulting in greater polarization. An anodic surface area that is greater than the cathodic area results in small or no accelerated galvanic effects because of the predominant polarization of the more noble material [11]."}
{"text": "The geometry enters into the evaluation of the galvanic effects because current flows through the path of least resistance,this means that the current will not readily flow around corners.This and the previously discussed distance relationships illustrate that galvanic effects are adjacent effects and are essentially line of sight."}
{"text": "protrusions into the flow stream that could change flow rates by introducing turbulent flow,(4)change the environment to reduce the corrosivity,(5)add corrosion inhibitors,(6)mod- ify environment by filtering to remove solids,and (7)use corrosion resistant coatings or hardsurfacings."}
{"text": "Cavitation has been observed in production and drilling chokes,mud motors and drilling mud pumps.Cavitation damage can be minimized or avoided by designing to reduce hydrodynamic pressure differences,coating metals with rubber or plastic and using more corrosion resistant alloys."}
{"text": "The mechanism of fretting corrosion involves either the previously noted disruption of the protective surface films or oxidization/corrosion of wear debris.Fretting corrosion may be avoided or reduced by(1)surface coatings,(2)lubri- cation,(3)increasing surface hardness,(4)using gaskets to absorb vibrational movement,(5)increasing relative motion between surfaces,and (6)decreasing contact stress.These mitigation techniques are the same as those used to reduce the occurrence of adhesive type wear(galling)."}
{"text": "In moderate to low strength steels,we typically find that this endurancelimit is in the range ofof the tensile strength [24].Fatigue can occur as the result of cyclical tensile stresses (lower and higher tensile stresses)as well as stresses reversals where the stress cycles between a zero or compressive stress state and a tensile stress state."}
{"text": "cyclical formation and break-down of protective surface films during cyclical stress cycles and the harmful effects of absorbed hydrogen.An example of a corrosion related site that provides a notch is a corrosion pit."}

{"text": "From the earlier examples,we can note that mate- rial strength level,applied stress,acidity,temperature,and specific agent concentration are frequently important or controlling factors in stress corrosion cracking."}
{"text": "For each alloy and condition under a specific set of environmental conditions thereisa threshold stress intensity below which stress corrosion cracking will not occur.The stress intensity is effected by bulk applied stress,stress concentration factors,and residual stresses.Values of this stress intensity have been reported to be as low as 10%of the yield strength [8]."}
{"text": "There are a number of ways to prevent stress corrosion cracking.The following list is presented as examples of mitigation techniques."}
{"text": "1.Change the material to one that is more resistant to SCC under the specific environmental conditions."}
{"text": "2.Avoid the metallurgical characteristics of the chosen material that could lead to SCC.These include avoiding susceptible microstructures and phases and reducing material stress levels."}
{"text": "the pH,limiting or changing the operating temperature, reduction of the environmental agents that promote SCC and the addition of corrosion inhibitors."}
{"text": "4. Apply anodic or cathodic protection to change the poten- tial out ofthe critical range where SCC occurs.Caution for SCC,the application of an anodic potential may accelerate the cracking."}
{"text": "5.Use metallic or nonmetallic coatings as barriers to the corrosive environment or that are resistant to the corro- sion/stress corrosion cracking mechanisms."}
{"text": "6.Reduce stresses by reduction of operating stresses, avoiding stress concentrations and introducing benefi- cial compressive stresses."}
{"text": "damage [29,30].A crack occurs when the atomic hydro- gen migrates to one of these trap sites and then becomes “trapped.”\n\nWe know that inclusions,especially elongated man- ganese sulfide inclusions,increase susceptibility to HIC damage.The other known major factor is alloy segregation in the form of banding.Banding is particularly a problem in plate and pipe formed from plate products but can be seen in seamless pipe as well."}
{"text": "To avoid HIC,clean steels with uniform microstructures have the best resistance to this form of cracking.There are standard tests that are used to assess a materials susceptibil- ity to HIC,the most widely accepted standard test method is NACE's TM-0284[31]."}
{"text": "4.19.2.11 Hydrogen-Induced Cracking\n\nThere are many forms of damage that occur as a result of hydrogen.These are typically categorized by the role of stress in the mechanism.The three types of damage that are observed are(1)hydrogen induced cracking(HIC), (2)stress-oriented hydrogen induced cracking (SOHIC), and(3)sulfide stress cracking(SSC).In HIC,the externally applied stress is low and low and does not interact with the cracking mechanism.In SOHIC,this is essentially the same as HIC except that the external stress influences the orientation or direction of the crack propagation.In SSC,the stress is an integral component of the cracking mechanism and does not occur without the application of applied stress."}
{"text": "In HIC,failures can occur at applied stress levels that are a fraction of the yield strength.For example,there have been many well-documented [28]failures due to HICin low strength pipeline steels in gas transmission lines containing H₂S."}
{"text": "There are several competing mechanisms that result in SSC including internal hydrogen stressing,hydrogen embitterment,stress corrosion cracking and combinations of these mechanisms.These competing mechanisms have complicated the identification of a universally accepted molecular mechanism that explains all of the observed phenomena."}
{"text": "materials in less severe environments as defined by increas- ing temperature."}
{"text": "There are numerous other factors that effect SSC such as the presence of oxygen and elemental sulfur that increase the severity of the environment.Care must be taken with materials selection when these are encountered."}
{"text": "4.19.2.13 Microbiologically Induced Corrosion (MIC)\n\nMicroorganisms are present throughout our environment. These organisms can result in corrosion by producing a deposit on metal surfaces and/or by increasing the acidity/ reducing the pH of the environment.This altering of the environment can occur in the bulk or locally."}
{"text": "There are two basic classes of microbes,anaeorbic and aerobic microorganisms.Anaerobic microorganisms flourish in the absence of oxygen such as deep sea or downhole environments.Aerobic microorganisms require oxygen to survive and flourish and are found in all surface environments including salt and fresh waters."}
{"text": "There are many iron oxidizing types of bacteria such as Gallionalla and Crenothrix that can accelerate corrosion by releasing carbon dioxide(CO₂)as one of the corrosion products as illustrated by the following equation."}
{"text": "In addition to the bacteria examples mentioned previ- ously,there are also molds,yeasts,algae,and protozoa. Molds,yeasts,algae,and protozoa can have a waste product that enhances corrosion or can result in slimes or deposits. Oxygen concentration cells and localized corrosion attack can result beneath these deposits."}
{"text": "The effect of H₂S when combined with CO₂is com- plicated by the interaction of the sulfide corrosion products with the carbonate corrosion products.The sulfide corrosion products from the H₂S often increase the stability of the surface film thereby reducing the corrosion rate."}
{"text": "4.19.3.2 Environments Causing Cracking\n\nThe oil field has a diverse list of potential environments that can cause cracking as well as corrosion.In production oper- ations,we can have heavy brines,production gases/fluids including H₂S and CO2,chlorides,organic acids and ele- mental sulfur.In drilling operations,we can have alkaline (high pH)drilling fluids,brines and the exposure with production fluids.In well stimulation and workover opera- tions,we can have acids (hydrochloric,fluoric and organic) and oxygen.It is this diverse nature that complicates the mitigation of corrosion and environmental cracking."}
{"text": "previously.We can add to this by adding a discussion on chlorides,elemental sulfur and oxygen."}
{"text": "for SCC increases with increasing temperature,stress and chloride content.The potential for SCC can be influenced by the presence of hydrogen sulfide and even small amount of oxygen or elemental sulfur has a dramatic negative effect on susceptibility to SCC."}
{"text": "4.19.3.3 Petroleum Phases(Oil,Gas and Water)\n\nCorrosion occurs as a result of contact with water phases that may contain one or more potential corrodents.The corrosion rates generally increase with increasing water content (also known as water cut).When water is present with a gas phase,the gases dissolve in the water and this acidifies the water.A gas phase that contains a small water fraction could be more corrosive due to its acidified nature."}
{"text": "4.19.3.4 Injected Fluids(Drilling Fluids, Oxygen and Acids)\n\nDrilling fluids are comprised of many potential constituents. The drilling fluid could be water based,oil based or syn- thetic based.Brines are a form of water-based fluids.The fluids could have the pH adjusted to high levels with the use of alkalis such as sodium and potassium hydroxide. The role of the drilling fluid on corrosion is related to many factors,including the pH,the chloride content,and the oxygen content."}
{"text": "The highest corrosion rates are found in corrosive sys- tems in the presence of even minute quantities of oxygen. Oxygen has anodic and cathodic effects in that it acts as a cathodic depolarizer and an anodic polarizer.Oxygen accelerates corrosion due to other corrodents such as CO₂, H₂S,salt solutions,and injected mineral acids."}
{"text": "Acids can result in very rapid corrosion rates and the can render normally passive materials active.When passive materials become active,there can be localized as well as general corrosion.One risk in many downhole anaerobic conditions is that the active pits may not repassivate when the acids are no longer in contact with the metal."}
{"text": "one of the materials of construction used or may cause corrosion by the flow of spend acid where the inhibitor is no longer present or effective."}
{"text": "4.19.4.1 Drill String Components\n\nThe drill string serves the purposes of conducting drilling fluids to the drilling bit,conducting rotational forces to the drill bit,controlling the amount of weight on bit and providing an annulus space between the formation or casing and the drill string to allow for removal of cuttings and drilling fluids.Components that fit into the drill string include drill pipe,drill collars,stabilizers,tool joints,jars, and miscellaneous crossovers and subs.The two basic types of tubulars are the drill pipe itself and drill collars.The drill pipe is composed of the pipe body and either integrally forged (upset)connections or forged and welded-on tool joints."}
{"text": "The typical materials of construction for drill pipe,stabi- lizers,collars,and tool joints are chromium—molybdenum (Cr-Mo)low alloy steels in the quenched and tempered condition such as specific alloys 4135,4140,and 4145. There has also been some use of aluminum drill pipe and nonmagnetic collars and subs made from beryllium copper and austenitic type stainless steels."}
{"text": "In drilling environments,the corrosion is typically min- imized through the use of pH control,inhibitors and/or the use of natural or synthetic oil based fluids.Corrosion when the controlled drilling environment is functioning as designed is generally not a concern except in some cases of stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement in very high strength steels.An exception is aluminum alloy equipment that may experience accelerated general corrosion in high pH environments as well as low pH environments."}
{"text": "In underbalanced drilling and where drilling fluid con- trol is lost,the drilling equipment may encounter production fluids that may be mixed with lower quantities of drilling fluids.In these cases,accelerated general corrosion rates may be encountered and the risk of environmental cracking increases with increasing concentrations of H₂S and lower pH levels."}
{"text": "4.19.4.2 Motors,Jars and Drilling Bits\n\nDrilling motors,jars and bits are very complicated pieces of hardware that utilize a variety of materials that serve very specialized functions.These components are grouped together because they are used in conjunction with each other and each utilizes specialized materials with unique types of service.The bits and motors exhibit a relatively short finite life."}
{"text": "Drilling motors,specifically downhole mud motors, work by taking the hydraulic action of the drilling fluid and converting it to a rotational force.Instead of rotating an entire drill string,the mud motor will be at the end of a non-rotating work string or coiled tubing and provide the rotational forces necessary to drill the formation."}
{"text": "Jars are composed of high strength materials and their function is to store energy that can be released to create a jar or impact on the bottom hole assembly(BHA)that is usually comprised of the bit,subs and collars.The impact motion of the jar is used to free\"stuck\"pipe or BHAs. The jars are made from Cr-Mo and Ni-Cr-Mo steels with 4140 and 4340 types being typical.The jars are subjected to fatigue and impact type failures.Corrosion is not an expected failure mode for this product."}
{"text": "Drilling bits may either be the tricone \"rotating cone\"or the drag \"fixed cone\"variety.Both types incorporate hard drilling elements that cut into the formation by cutting and fracturing forces aided by hit hydraulics\n\nThe cutting elements of the drilling bits are either the mining grade type of cemented tungsten carbides or natural/ synthetic diamonds.The diamonds may be as natural stones or formed into polycrystalline diamond compacts (PDCs). The body of the drag bit may be a matrix head (a high strength braze type material with hard particles embedded in it or a hardened steel head with the cutting elements brazed or press-fit into it.The tricone type of drilling bit is composed of three drilling cones or heads that are attached to three legs or bodies and the assembly is joined together.The steel cones and legs are typically alloyed Ni-Cr-Mo carburizing grades of steel such as 4820 and 9310.The bearings that permit bit rotation under extremely high bearings forces are very highly engineered and utilize such materials as beryllium copper,spinoidal copper alloys, cobalt base wear resistant alloys,hardened tool and stainless steels and cemented tungsten carbides."}
{"text": "Though there are occasionally corrosion failures in these products,the product lives are normally too short to be subjected to the majority of the potential corrosion mech- anisms.This is not true if the drilling fluid is not controlled, the action of corrosion in production fluids such as hydrogen sulfide containing gas/water phases can cause cracking in very short periods of time(minutes or hours)."}
{"text": "One problem shared by mud motors and drilling bits is the susceptibility to premature failure due to environmental interactions between the mud motor elastomer or tricone bit seal and the drilling fluid.There have been instances of motor and bit failures that have resulted from elastomer property deterioration in drilling fluids."}
{"text": "A diverter is sometimes used in conjunction with a BOP stack to divert the gas from the annulus away from the stack."}
{"text": "specific elastomers and care must be taken to ensure that the elastomers and the drilling fluids are compatible."}
{"text": "4.19.4.4 Casing and Hangers\n\nCasing is a pipe that is used in the oil and gas industry to ensure a pressure tight connection from the surface to the reservoir being produced.There are many reasons for using casing including the following listed by Petroleum Extension service [44]."}
{"text": "The casing can be made from a variety of materials ranging from low carbon steels to very highly alloyed nickel base alloys.The alloy and grade selection is based on strength requirements and the anticipated type of corrosion service.Liner hangers and casing are generally made from similar materials though the liner hangers are often made of higher strength corrosion resistant alloys."}
{"text": "The corrosion problems that could occur in casing and iner hangers include SSC,SCC,pitting corrosion,crevice corrosion,and general corrosion."}
{"text": "with these products in drilling fluids and cement.There can be corrosion problems in production environments or acids."}
{"text": "workover operations.The coiled tubing is continuous length meaning that there are no joints or connections."}
{"text": "The coiled tubing is usually made from HSLA type steels with the most popular type being a weathering type of HSLA steel.The strength level of the coiled tubing ranges from about 400MPa(60ksi)to about 750MPa(110 ksi). The weathering type of steel has small intentional additions of chromium,copper and nickel to improve corrosion resis- tance."}
{"text": "Other materials have been made and used in coiled tub- ing including 13%chromium stainless steel,15%chromium stainless steel and titanium."}
{"text": "The coiled tubing is susceptible to fatigue and corrosion fatigue,pitting corrosion,general corrosion and SSC in the high strength grades of coiled tubing.One of the biggest problems with respect to corrosion and coiled tubing is the pitting corrosion that can occur as a result of acidizing operations."}
{"text": "The marine risers are typically made from line pipe steels (usually high strength low alloy steels known as HSLA steels)such as X65,X70,and X80 and low alloy steels such as 4130."}
{"text": "Another consideration that effects all oilfield equipment, but should be stressed for drilling equipment,is the storage and care of equipment between uses.Other equipment types that more commonly encounter corrosion problems are generally better suited to withstand coastal or offshore storage than drilling equipment.Drilling equipment that functions well in the intended drilling environments may exhibit severe corrosion during storage periods."}
{"text": "4.19.5 Mitigation Techniques\n\nMitigation techniques include controlled strength level range steels,coatings,inhibitors,corrosion resistant alloys and surfacings.Some of the common mitigation techniques that are applicable to the corrosion mechanism are discussed in the section where the mechanism is discussed.This section summarizes some of these techniques and relates them to drilling and completion equipment."}
{"text": "4.19.5.2 Design\n\nOften the design of the equipment is as important as the material selection in preventing serious corrosion problems. Many types of corrosion such as sulfide stress corrosion (SSC)and stress corrosion cracking (SCC)may be mit- igated by reducing the stress level and avoiding stress concentrations.Crevice corrosion may be avoided my pre- venting tight crevices."}
{"text": "4.19.5.3 Coatings and Surfacings\n\nThere are several types of coatings that are used to prevent corrosion in drilling and well completion equipment.These can be broadly classed as metallic coatings,inorganic coat- ings and organic coatings.With all of these classes,the one feature that has a huge role in the final success rate is the surface preparation.The surface needs to be clean and free of contaminants and exhibit the proper surface profile for the specific coating being applied."}
{"text": "Inorganic coatings includes include (1)surface con- versions,(2)inorganic zinc silicate,(3)HVOF ceramic coatings,and (4)flame and arc spray ceramic coatings. The common surface conversions are anodizing used on aluminum,phosphating and oxidizing processes used on steels and chromate surface conversions on steel."}
{"text": "Organic coatings include(1)epoxy paints,(2)acrylic paints,(3)polyurethane paints,(4)organic zinc paints, (5)phenolic coatings,(6)epoxy-phenolic coatings, (7)fluorocarbon based coatings,(8)molybdenum disulfide coatings,(9)and silicone paints and coatings.Generally, where the word paint appears in the above list,the coating consists of at least two components,one a carrier and one the paint.In many cases,with two or more part products that are mixed,the paint undergoes a chemical reaction causing or assisting in the curing and/or drying cycles. The coatings listed above that do not list plant generally require a heat curing cycle that sets the coating onto the substrate."}
{"text": "2.They induce formation of a thick corrosion product, which forms a passive layer."}
{"text": "3.They change the characteristics of the environment either by producing protective particulates or by remov- ing or inactivating an aggressive constituent in the envi-\n\nronments."}
{"text": "and oxygen scavengers.Of these,oxygen scavengers are the type that are used in drilling and well completion operations."}
{"text": "When the inhibitor is added to the environment,it is either added continuously or by batch.When added contin- uously,a small quantity is added to maintain a minimum concentration in the environment.When added by batch, a much larger concentration is added at intervals that are determined through monitoring."}
{"text": "When inhibition is selected as the means by which cor- rosion is prevented,the environment should be monitored to ensure a minimum effectiveness of the inhibitor.This is true regardless of the addition method,continuous or batch."}
{"text": "4.19.6 Corrosion Monitoring and Equipment Inspection\n\nOne way to combat corrosion is to maintain an effective corrosion-monitoring program to supplement good preven- tative measures.It is also very important to keep complete records of monitoring programs,control programs and fail- ures that occur."}
{"text": "An effective corrosion control program should be able to detect evidence of corrosion and identify the causes.There- fore,continuous monitoring is essential during drilling operations because the nature of drilling fluid corrosivity changes as the hole is drilled and different formations are penetrated.Several techniques of monitoring corrosion should be used simultaneously whenever possible,and records need to be kept."}
{"text": "systems.The technique involves monitoring electrical potential of one of the electrodes with respect to one of the other electrodes as a small electrical current is applied.The amount of applied current necessary to change potential(no more than 10 to 20mV)is proportional to corrosion inten- sity.The electronic meter converts the amount of current to read out a number that represents the corrosion rate in mpy.Before recording the data,sufficient time should be allowed for the electrodes to reach equilibrium with the environment.The corrosion-rate reading obtained by these instruments is due to corrosion of the probe element at that instant [22]."}
{"text": "The limitation of these instruments is that they only indicate overall corrosion rates.Their sensitivity is affected by deposition of corrosion products,mineral scales or accu- mulation of hydrocarbons.Corrosivity of a system can be measured only if the continuous component of the system is an electrolyte.These devices may not adequately predict localized corrosion."}
{"text": "If the instrument indicates current surge in an air-free system,it generally implies hydrogen sulfide contamination,but the galvanic probe is usually best suited to detect corrosion influenced by oxygen contamination. Other limitations of this instrument are the same as those of linear polarization instruments discussed earlier."}
{"text": "4.19.6.4 Corrosion Coupons\n\nThe most direct method of evaluating the corrosivity of an environment is the use of corrosion coupons.In drilling operations,a drill string corrosion coupon is a ring coupon machined from a section of tubing and sized to fit into the relief groove in the tool joint box."}
{"text": "Weighing the coupon before and after exposure,and evaluating the change in weight permits a determination of the severity of general corrosion attack.Before installation the coupon must be clean (i.e.,free of any corrosion, grease marks,drops of perspiration,etc.)and weighed. After exposure to the system for a known period of time, the coupon is retrieved,visually examined,then cleaned and reweighed within one tenth of a milligram.The dif- ference between the initial and final weights is attributed to corrosion and converted to a corrosion rate knowing the surface area of the corrosion coupon exposed to the environment."}
{"text": "There are several factors such as handling,surface preparation and cleaning,etc.,which can affect the results of the tests.The results obtained from this test assume uni- form corrosion.Therefore,for proper analysis it becomes very important to include a complete description of the exposed coupons.One of the most important factors is visual inspection of the coupon,describing the form of attack and identifying the corrosion by-product."}
{"text": "exposure,while the corrosion may vary appreciably up and down the hole.Finally,the results are not available until the tool containing the coupon is pulled out of the hole."}
{"text": "4.19.7 Recommended Practices\n\nEquipment failure due to corrosion is one problem that inevitably rears its ugly head during drilling operations."}
{"text": "Corrosion control is an essential factor in any engineering design and must be considered as early as the initial phase of the operation.An effective and most cost-efficient corrosion control program is imperative for a successful drilling operation.Some recommended practices are as follows [2,14,19,22,49,50]."}
{"text": "4.19.7.1 Drilling Operations\n\n1.Use quenched and tempered drill pipe that meets the API requirements for drill pipe."}
{"text": "2.Avoid the use of shrink-type tool joints on drill pipes and drill collars (connectors,in this case).Flash- welded or friction welded tool joints for drill pipes and integral drill-collar joints should be used."}
{"text": "3.Utilize proper make-up torque on tool joints."}
{"text": "4.Use internally,plastic-coated drillpipe at all times.The coating must be holiday-free to be effective."}
{"text": "5.Consider the use of heavy-wall (thick wall)drillpipe in severely corrosive conditions.Heavy walls reduce stress levels and extend the service life of drill pipe."}
{"text": "6.Materials used for tool joints are generally modified 4135 steel.They are heat treated by quenching and tempering at temperatures equal to or above 1150°F to hardness of Rc 30 to Rc 37 and yield strength ranging from 120,000 psi to 135,000 psi."}
{"text": "7.Most drill collars are also made with materials similar to those used for tool joints.Where possible,use heavy walls are used to reduce stress levels."}
{"text": "8.limit exposure time of the drillstem to the corrosive environment during drillstem tests.Amaximum of one hour is recommended."}
{"text": "9.Sustained exposure of drill pipe to operating tem- peratures above 300°F(149℃)must be limited to a maximum of 10hr."}
{"text": "10.Run enough drill collars to keep all drill pipe in tension in order to reduce wear and stress on tool joints."}
{"text": "11. Use controlled drilling fluids at all times and minimize contamination by potential corrodents."}
{"text": "12. Use oxygen and hydrogen sulfide scavengers when appropriate to reduce corrosion rates."}

{"text": "3.Use thread protectors on tool joints when moving or racking pipes."}
{"text": "4.Avoid chafing a tool-joint shoulders on adjacent joints."}
{"text": "5.Keep load binding chains tight at all times."}
{"text": "6.Avoid damaging coatings as well as the pipe itself."}
{"text": "4.19.7.3 Handling\n\n1.Before unloading,make sure that the thread protectors are tightly in place."}
{"text": "2.Avoid rough handling that can damage the pipe in any way."}
{"text": "3.The pipe must not be dropped at any time."}
{"text": "5.When rolling down skids,roll pipe parallel to the stack. Do not let the pipe gather any momentum and strike the ends.This can damage threads even when the protectors are in place."}
{"text": "6.Avoid creating knicks or notches on the drillpipe."}
{"text": "4.19.7.4 Chemical Additives\n\n1.When high temperatures above 300°F are expected,do not use sulfur-containing compounds as drilling fluid additives."}
{"text": "2.Use only chemical additives that are compatible with drilling fluids in circulatory systems."}
{"text": "3.Avoid using copper-based compounds such as copper carbonate.Copper can\"plate out\"on steel and set up galvanic corrosion cells,resulting in accelerated corro- sion of the steel."}
{"text": "4.Maintain the pH level of the drilling fluid around 9.5 to reduce corrosion.However,when aluminum drill pipes are in use,the pHmust be maintained between 9.5 and 7."}
{"text": "6.Caustics should be dissolved in water before being added.The mixture should be mixed well with mud guns in the pit prior to pumping into the hole."}

Understanding and incorporating regulatory requirements early in the design and planning stages will reduce delays and support effective,yet flexible operations that meet regulatory requirements and protect the environment and stakeholders.Section 6.9 provides more detail regarding regulatory agencies and associated requirements for drilling and oil and gas operations considerations re:oil pollution prevention,waste management,spill prevention,remedia- tion,and produced water management."}
{"text": "In construction of the pad,brush and trees are pushed to one area.Topsoil is then removed from the site and stockpiled for respreading during subsequent seeding oper- ations.The leveled pad is slightly crowned using additional material with a lower permeability factor,if native soils are not sufficient,to reduce vertical infiltration of spills.The pad is sloped to move fluids collected on the pad to the perimeter,where drainage ditches divert this fluid to the reserve pit.In the event a subsurface pit is not possible,the drainage will run into a small sump.This sump is used as a holding tank for pumping of collected fluids to an elevated reserve pit."}
{"text": "When possible,the reserve pit is placed on the low side of the location to reduce dirt removal.In this event,the pit wall should be keyed into the earth and the summation of forces and moments on the retaining wall calculated to prevent failure.Pits most often fail because of leaking liners undercutting the retaining wall and sliding out.A minimum horizontal-to-vertical slope of2is recommended for earthen dams [6].The pit bottom should be soft filled to prevent liner tears.Other key factors of the location provide for the drainage of all precipitation away from the location.This prevents the operator from unduly managing it as a waste product.Any water landing on the location must be diverted to the reserve pit."}
{"text": "Material management at the site can include a system whereby wastes are diverted to separate holding facilities according to the hazard imposed by the waste.Separate pits are created to hold rig washing and precipitation wastes, solid wastes,and drilling fluids [5].The waste is then reused,disposed on site,or hauled away for offsite treat- ment.The system reduces contamination of less hazardous materials with more hazardous materials,thereby reducing disposal costs."}
{"text": "Many frac jobs are mini-fraced before the actual oper- ation and the design criteria established before the actual frac job is accomplished.The method helps prevent the screening out of the well beforehand.The screened-out well causes potential problems not only in productivity but also in waste management.The unused mixed chemicals,such as KCl makeup water in frac tanks leftover due to the screenout,must be properly disposed.An alternative to this is the mixing of chemicals on the fly instead of preblending and stocking in frac tanks.Some chemicals,such as KClin water,must be mixed well in advance on location to attain heightened concentrations.In theses in instances,a properly designed frac job,based on the mini-frac,will allow for some certainty in getting the designed job away.Frac flow back may be introduced to the reserve pit after separation from any hydrocarbons.Current frac fluids are composed of primarily of natural organics such as guar gum,but they may contain other components that may be harmful to the environment.Containment offlowback in a lined reserve pit before disposal is a prudent practice."}
{"text": "Care should be taken in every stimulation circumstance to allow fluids to drain to the reserve pit.In the com- pletion operation,it is exceedingly difficult to accomplish this because of traffic,and the service company should therefore provide leak-free hoses,lines,and connections. On completion of the job,the hoses should be drained to a common area for holding subsequent to introduction to the reserve pit.Every precaution should be taken to prevent accumulation of fluids on the pad proper,thereby posing a potential risk to groundwater and runoff of location."}
{"text": "As with the drilling operation,the equipment on location providing the completion service may leak oil.The use of absorbents and catch pans is advised."}
{"text": "4.20.5.4 Reclamation of the Drill Site\n\nIn the event of a dry hole,the reserve pit water usage should be maximized to prepare the mud spacers between plugs.Water in excess of this may be pumped into the hole,including solids.All USDWs must be protected in this event.Once the hole has been properly plugged and the drilling rig removed,the mousehole and rathole should be backed filled immediately to preclude any accidents.Trash is removed from the location and adjacent area and is hauled to permit facilities."}
{"text": "4.20.5.5 Reserve Pit Closure\n\nThe reserve pit commonly holds all fluids introduced to the wellbore during drilling and completion opera- tions.This includes the drilling and completion fluids in the event the well is stimulated for production and those cuttings produced during the drilling operation.The reserve pit,on completion of the initial rig site activi- ties,must be reclaimed.On removal of the drilling rig, the reserve pit is fenced to prevent wildlife and livestock from watering.The fence is removed on initiation of reclamation."}
{"text": "The fluids from the reserve pit may be hauled away from location for disposal,reclaimed in situ,or pumped into the wellbore given a dry hole.The operator of the well site is responsible for the transportation offsite of the drilling fluids.The fluids may be considered hazardous in nature due to the toxic characteristics of most drilling and completion fluids."}
{"text": "4.20.5.6 Evaporation\n\nEvaporation of the water held in the pit is often the first step in the reserve pit remediation because of economic considerations about trucking and disposal.The evapora- tion may be mechanically driven or take place naturally.

{"text": "One of the more remarkable technological accomplishments of the modern era is the ability of mankind to explore for and produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas in what are often remote and hostile offshore environments. While offshore petroleum operations have existed for more than half a century,major advances in seismic,drilling and production technology have recently pushed the frontiers to ever deeper waters.What a few years ago was considered deep water—about 650 feet—is no longer regarded as extraordinary,and the very definition of deep water has expanded to 3,000 feet and beyond.In the wake of these innovations,offshore provinces have grown to account for about 25%to 30%of all U.S.production and about 30%of estimated undiscovered reserves."}
{"text": "Beyond that,well planning,logistics and execution take on added responsibility when carried out in a distant,often harsh marine environment hundreds of miles from sight of the nearest landmass [1-8]."}
{"text": "Drilling barges,commonly employed in inland waters and marshes,can be used where water depths do not exceed about 20ft.These self-contained vessels provide the least expensive drilling option,but have limited applicability because of water depth and environmental limitations."}
{"text": "Submersible rigs likewise are used strictly in shallow water-in depths of 80ft or less.They have two hulls— the upper containing crew quarters and the drilling rig and the lower filled with air,making the vessel buoyant. Submersibles are towed to their location,where the air in the bottom hull is displaced with sea water for weight and the rig is lowered to the sea floor."}
{"text": "Drillships and semisubmersible rigs are the two domi- nant types of floating drilling vessels-and can operate in shallow,deep and ultra-deep water."}
{"text": "Vertical vessel motion is accommodated by adding a telescoping(slip)joint at the surface.This joint will usually allow up to 50 ft(double amplitude)of vertical vessel motion.Lateral motion is compensated for by the use of ball/flex joint connections at the sea floor and surface."}
{"text": "4.21.1.2 Casing Programs\n\nCasing programs offshore typically consist of 30-in. structural,20-in.conductor,13g-in.surface,and! intermediate casing strings.Because seawater is in per- fect communication with the sediments,pore pressure is increased by increasing water depth,and the margin between fracture pressure and pore pressure is lessened."}
{"text": "production casing to facilitate larger production tubing and quicker payout [9,10]."}
{"text": "4.21.1.3 Well Control\n\nOffshore,well control equipment and associated operations present some differences from that seen and used onshore. In some instances,onshore equipment can be employed, but the offshore environment generally dictates a modi- fication of equipment and procedures.There are several different well control equipment configurations used off- shore depending on the type of drilling unit employed and the stage of the drilling operation,and each configuration requires the use of specific well control procedures that should be followed.A well may be controlled with a surface blowout preventer stack;a subsea blowout preventer stack, riser and diverter system;a riser and diverter system with no blowout preventer;or a diverter only [10,11]."}
{"text": "4.21.1.4 Surface Blowout Preventer Stacks\n\nWhen a development platform has been set,or a bottom supported drilling rig is used,wells can be drilled with a \"land-type\"well design.Conductor casing is set from above sea level,through the water,to as much as 1,500 feet subsea.The conductor provides a conduit for mud returns, and allows blowout preventers to be located at the sur- face,increasing system flexibility and easing maintenance requirements.This BOP equipment layout is essentially identical to that used onshore,as are the well control procedures employed [10,11]."}
{"text": "When the well is circulated through the choke line, a rapid loss in hydrostatic pressure is encountered when the kick fluid begins to enter the choke line.Hydrostatic pressure is lost because low-density gas is displacing the drilling mud from the small volume of choke line.Small kick volumes can result in long columns of gas in the choke line.Surface choke response must be rapid enough to prevent a loss of bottom hole pressure,otherwise new kick fluid may enter the wellbore due to the reduction in bottom hole pressure.Also,when kill fluid enters the choke line and begins to displace the kick fluid,hydrostatic pressure will increase rapidly,thus increasing bottomhole pressure.Slow response by the choke operator can fracture the formation.A choke operator is faced with a demanding job when pumping out a kick through a subsurface blowout preventer."}
{"text": "4.21.1.7 Diverter Systems\n\nShallow gas hazards are a common potential danger off- shore.Quite often,these hazards can be spotted in seismic analysis,and a surface location chosen to avoid the hazard. Howeverthere is always a risk of encountering a shallow gas flow with insufficient casing in the well to allow a shut-in.In this instance a diverter system is used as a safety device.In many cases the diverter system simply provides enough time to evacuate the rig[9-11]."}
{"text": "The BSEE requires a minimum 10-inch-diameter diverter vent lines,but many operators are now using as large as 16-inch-diameter vent lines."}
{"text": "While a bottom-supported vessel must divert when shal- low gas is encountered,a floating vessel has the additional option of simply abandoning the well.This option has led to the use of riserless systems when drilling the surface hole.However,a dynamic kill provides the only means of controlling the well.A dynamic kill makes use of annu- lar circulating friction as well as a heavier mud to hold backpressure on the formation.If very short wellbores are involved,the dynamic kill rates are usually too large to be practical."}
{"text": "4.21.2 Deepwater Well Planning Considerations\n\nAs the offshore industry moves into ever-deeper water to globally explore for and produce oil and natural gas in commercial quantities,particular and complex chal- lenges arise in terms of health,safety and environmental considerations—which are always of the highest priority— as well as well planning and logistics."}
{"text": "Deepwater drilling is one of the greatest drilling chal- lenges in existence today.Failures in the design of the structural casing string and wellhead have proven to be very expensive.A conservative design approach,incorporating stringent safety,environmental and regulatory requirements compliance factors and considering the risks and uncertain- ties of\"worst-case\"design assumptions is followed when planning these wells."}
{"text": "Deepwater well planning requires special attention be given to such considerations as reduced annular clearances, higher equivalent circulating densities (ECD's),increased cementing difficulty,well angle,hydrate formation,ocean currents,deepwater hydrostatic pressures and stresses, casing design,drilling fluids,flow control,kick preven- tion,detection and response,well testing and intervention operations."}
{"text": "The narrowing of the pore pressure/frac gradient win- dow requires more casing strings to reach the well objec- tives.The small annular clearances resulting from the need to set a large number of casing strings are particularly problematic,affecting all facets of the well drilling oper- ation.For example,tight annular clearances restrict the flow of the drilling mud in the casing and wellbore annuli, resulting in high annular circulating pressures.This raises the equivalent circulating density(ECD)of the drilling mud to the point where wellbore \"breathing\"(ballooning)and lost circulation often may occurs.The problem is even more severe when performing casing cementing operations, where the high ECD's may result in lost circulation,making it very difficult to achieve a good primary cement job.Well control becomes more difficult because the elevated ECD's increase the probability that shoe fracture pressure will be exceeded while killing the well."}

{"text": "The dissolved gas also has an important effect on the volume of the produced oil.Asthe gas comes out of solution the oil shrinks so that the liquid oil at surface conditions will occupy less volume than the gas-saturated oil occupied in the reservoir.The number of barrels of reservoir oil at reservoir pressure and temperature which will yield one barrel of stock tank oil at 60°F and atmospheric pressure is referred to as the formation volume factor or reservoir volume factor.Formation volume factors are described in a subsequent section.The solution gas-oil ratio is the number of standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of stock tank oil."}
{"text": "5.1.1.2 Water\n\nRegardless of whether a reservoir yields pipeline oil,water in the form commonly referred to as interstitial or connate is present in the reservoir in pores small enough to hold it by capillary forces."}
{"text": "The theory that this water was not displaced by the migration of oil into a water-bearing horizon is generally accepted as explanation of its presence."}
{"text": "The amount of the interstitial water is usually inversely proportional to the permeability of the reservoir.The inter- stitial water content of oil-producing reservoirs often ranges from 10%to 40%of saturation."}
{"text": "Consideration of interstitial water content is of particular importance in reservoir studies,in estimates of crude oil reserves and in interpretation of electrical logs."}
{"text": "reservoir pressure,viscosity will decrease slightly as the reservoir pressure decreases.A minimum viscosity will occur at the saturation pressure.At pressures below the bubble-point,evolution of gas from solution will increase the density and viscosity of the crude oil as the reservoir pressure is decreased further."}

{"text": "See References 36-40 for a list of books devoted to the use of programs for handheld calculators and personal computers."}
{"text": "Factors affecting porosity are compactness,character and amount of cementation,shape and arrangement of grains,and uniformity of grain size or distribution."}
{"text": "In problems involving porosity calculations it is con- venient to remember that a porosity of one percent is equivalent to the presence of 77.6 barrels of pore space in a total volume of one acre-foot of sand."}
{"text": "5.1.2.4 Absolute Permeability\n\nIf a porous system is completely saturated with a single fluid,the permeability is a rock property and not a property of the flowing fluid(with the exception of gases at low pressure).This permeability at 100%saturation of a single fluid is termed the absolute permeability."}
{"text": "5.1.2.6 Capacity\n\nFlow capacity is the product of permeability and reservoir thickness expressed in md ft.Since the rate of flow is proportional to capacity,a 10-ft thick formation with a permeability of 100md should have the same production as a 100-ft thick formation of 10md,if all other conditions are equivalent."}
{"text": "5.1.2.7 Transmissibility\n\nTransmissibility is flow capacity divided by viscosity or kh/μ with units of md f/cp.An increase in either reservoir permeability or thickness or a decrease in fluid viscosity will improve transmissibility of the fluid in the porous system."}
{"text": "5.1.2.8 Resistivity and Electrical Conductivity Electrical conductivity,the electrical analog of permeability, is the ability of a material to conduct an electrical current. With the exception of certain clay minerals,reservoir rocks are nonconductors of electricity.Crude oil and gas are also nonconductors.Water is a conductor if dissolved salts are present so the conduction of an electric current in reservoir rocks is due to the movement of dissolved ions in the brine that occupies the pore space.Conductivity varies directly with the ion concentration of the brine.Thus,the electrical properties of a reservoir rock depend on the fluids occupying the pores and the geometry of the pores."}
{"text": "During flow through a porous medium,the tortuous flow paths cause the flowing fluid to travel an effective length, Le,that is longer than the measured length,L.Some authors have defined this tortuosity,t,as(Le/L)while(Le/L)²has been used by others."}
{"text": "These samples included 569 core plugs (from Alaska, California,Louisiana,Colorado,Trinidad,Australia,and\n\nthe Middle East)plus 28 samples from Winsauer et al."}
{"text": "Other variables that affect resistivity of natural reservoir rocks include overburden pressure and temperature during measurement.The value of the cementation exponent,m, is normally higher at overburden conditions [62],especially if porosity is low or with rocks that are not well-cemented. Thus,Fr increases with increasing pressure.Although the effect of temperature depends on clay content of the sample, Fr tends to increase with increasing temperature,but the effect is not as great as pressure [63,64].At a fixed pressure,Fr may go through a minimum and then increase as temperature is increased;the combined increase of both temperature and pressure will cause an increase in FR[64]."}
{"text": "To summarize the general relationship between forma- tion resistivity factor and porosity (see Equation 5.1.49), the normal range for the geometric term,a,is 0.6 to 1.4, and the range for the cementation exponent,m,is 1.7 to 2.5 for most consolidated reservoir rocks [62].Since the exact values depend on pore geometry and composition of the rock,formation factors should be determined with samples ofthe reservoir rock of interest,under the reservoir conditions of temperature and overburden pressure."}

{"text": "amount of dissolved gas increases,but drops slightly as pressure is increased above the bubblepoint."}
{"text": "Surface and interfacial tensions are important in gov- erning the flow of fluids in the small capillaries present in oil-bearing reservoirs.The capillary forces in oil or gas reservoirs are the result of the combined effect of surface and interfacial tensions,pore size distribution,pore shape, and the wetting properties of the hydrocarbon/rock system."}
{"text": "5.1.3.4 Wettability and Contact Angle\n\nThe contact angle(θc),existing between two fluids in contact with a solid and measured through the more dense phase,is a measure of the relative wetting or spreading by a fluid on a solid.A contact angle of zero indicates complete wetting by the more dense phase,an angle of 180°indicates complete wetting of the less dense phase,and an angle of 90°means that neither fluid preferentially wets the solid."}
{"text": "illary pressures,there is a hysteresis in the receding and advancing (increase in wetting phase saturation)contact angles;receding angles are smaller than advancing angles [97].Bartell and coworkers [95-97]were among some of the first investigators to measure contact angles with crude oil systems that suggested the possibility that oil reservoirs may not be water-wet.Furthermore,they concluded that spontaneous displacement of oil by water should occur only when both advancing and receding angles are less than 90°,and no spontaneous imbibition should occur if the two angles are on opposite sides of 90°[97]."}
{"text": "For certain laboratory tests,it may be possible to clean reservoir cores with solvents and resaturate with reservoir fluids to restore the original wetting conditions.Details of preparing such restored-state or extracted cores are discussed subsequently in the section“Coring and Core Analysis.\"The concept of the method is to clean the core thoroughly until it is water-wet,saturate with reservoir brine,flush with crude oil,and age for over 1,000 hours at reservoir temperature."}
{"text": "When possible,tests should be made under reservoir conditions of temperature and pressure using live reservoir oil.This is an improvement over room condition tech- niques where tests are made at atmospheric conditions with refined laboratory oils.Use of the live crude exposes the rock to compounds present in the oil that might influence wettability,and establishes an environment as close as possible to reservoir conditions.Cores evaluated at atmo- spheric conditions may be more oil-wet than similar tests at reservoir conditions because of the decreased solubility of wettability-altering compounds at lower temperatures and pressures [107,123].In a recent contact angle study [93] with calcium carbonate crystals and a crude oil containing 27.3%resins and 2.2%asphaltenes,a complete reversal from a predominantly oil-wet system at lower temperatures to a predominantly water-wet system at higher temperatures was found.While pressure alone had little effect on the wettability of the system,the study speculated that the addi- tion of gas-in-solution with increasingpressure should favor a more water-wet situation than would be indicated from laboratory tests at atmospheric conditions.Even when all precautions have been taken,there is no absolute assurance that reservoir wettability has been duplicated."}
{"text": "5.1.3.5 Capillary Pressure\n\nCurvature at an interface between wetting and nonwetting phases causes a pressure difference that is called capillary pressure.This pressure can be viewed as a force per unit area that results from the interaction of surface forces and the geometry of the system."}
{"text": "An analogous situation can occur during two-phase flow in a porous medium.For example if capillary forces dom- inate in a water-wet rock,the existing pressure differential causes flow of the wetting fluid to occur through the smaller capillaries.However,if viscous forces dominate,flow will occur through the larger capillaries (from Pouiselle's law,as a function of the 4th power of the radius)."}
{"text": "Common laboratory methods of measuring capillary pressure include [19]:mercury injection,porous diaphragm or plate(restored state),centrifuge method,and steady-state flow in a dynamic method.While the restored state test is generally considered the most accurate,mercury injection is routinely used.However,it is necessary to correct the mercury injection data for wetting conditions before com- parison to results from the restored state test."}
{"text": "capillary pressure curve will generally increase with broader pore-size distribution."}
{"text": "Capillary pressure data are helpful in providing a qual- itative assessment of the transition zones in the reservoir. A transition zone is defined as the vertical thickness where saturation changes from 100%water to irreducible water for water-oil contact,or from 100%liquid to an irreducible water saturation for gas-oil contact."}
{"text": "gas permeabilities at infinite mean pressure,which is in contrast with the prior results of Klinkenberg.Furthermore, it has been shown [130]that liquid permeabilities decreased with increasing polarity of the liquid.For gas flow or brine flow in low-permeability sandstones,permeabilities were independent of temperature at all levels of confining pressure [130].The data [130]showed that for a given permeability core sample at a given confining pressure,the Klinkenberg slip factors and slopes of the Klinkenberg plots were proportional to the product of viscosity and the square root of absolute temperature."}

{"text": "An example of water-oil relative permeability plot vs."}
{"text": "Three-phase relative permeabilities pertaining to simul- taneous flow of gas,oil,and water have been provided in the literature [19,50].Since the occurrence of such three-phase flow in a reservoir is limited [20],relative permeabilities for these conditions will not be discussed in this chapterand the reader is referred to other sources [19,20,60,137,140,159,160]."}
{"text": "Based on the work of Corey [150]and Wyllie [23, 50],empirical equations have been summarized by Slider [20]to estimate relative permeabilities.These equations permit the estimation of kro from measurements of krg Other empirical equations for estimating two-phase relative permeabilities in consolidated rocks are available in the literature [161]."}
{"text": "Early work in unconsolidated sands showed that fluid viscosity or the range of permeability had negligible effects on the relationship between relative permeability and fluid saturation [76,100].Geffen et al.[141]confirmed that relative permeabilities in cores are not affected by fluid properties provided wettability is not altered.However, others [162,163]have found that viscosity ratio influences relative permeability data when the displacing fluid is non- wetting.For constant wettability conditions,the higher the viscosity of one of the liquids,the lower is the relative permeability of the other liquid [163]."}
{"text": "Geffen et al.[141]did cite a number of factors,in addition to fluid saturations,that affect relative perme- ability results.Because of capillary hysteresis,saturation history was important in that fluid distribution in the pores was altered.Flow rates during laboratory tests need to be sufficiently high to overcome capillary end effects (reten- tion of the wetting phase at the outlet end of the core) [141].According to Wyllie[23],relative permeability varies because of varying geometry of the fluid phases present, which is controlled by effective pore size distribution, method of obtaining the saturation(saturation history); heterogeneity of the core sample,and wettability of the rock-fluid system."}
{"text": "With water-wet cores in laboratory waterfloods,the oil production at water breakthrough ceases abruptly and water production increases sharply.With systems that are not water-wet,water breakthrough may occur earlier,but small fractions of oil are produced for long periods of time at high water cuts.In strongly water-wet systems,the residual oil that is permanently trapped by water resides in the larger pores,whereas in oil-wet systems trapping occurs in the smaller capillary spaces [106,133]."}

{"text": "The foregoing data suggest that unless the reservoir is known to be water-wet,the saturation exponent should be measured with native-state (preferably)or restored cores.If the reservoir is oil-wet and clean cores are used that may be water-wet,the saturation exponents that are obtained can lead to an underestimate of connate water saturation in the formation tested."}

A handbook[12]is available that describes procedures and tools for conventional coring as well as methods for routine core analysis.Procedures for routine core analysis and methods ofpreserving cores have been recommended by the American Petroleum Institute[13].Some of the information available in these sources will be highlighted."}
{"text": "5.2 FORMATION EVALUATION Section reviewed by Heru Danardatu\n\nFormation evaluation,as applied to petroleum reservoirs, consists of the quantitative and qualitative interpretation of formation cores,geophysical well logs,mud logs,flow tests, pressure tests,and samples of reservoir fluids.The goal of the interpretation is to provide information concerning reservoir lithology,fluid content,storage capacity,and pro- ducibility of oilor gas reservoirs.The final analysis includes an economic evaluation of whether to complete an oil or gas well and,once completed,an ongoing analysis of how to produce the well most effectively.These interpretations and analyses are affected by geological complexity of the reservoirrock quality,reservoir heterogeneity,and,from a logistical standpoint,the areal extent and location of the project of interest.In the early stages of development, the purpose of formation evaluation is to define reservoir thickness and areal extent,reservoir quality,reservoir fluid properties,and ranges of rock properties.The key rock properties are porosity,permeability,oil,gas,and water saturations.Because of space limitations and the importance of these properties,methods of measuring porosity,perme- ability,and fluid saturations will be emphasized."}

{"text": "5.2.1.4.3 Fluid Saturations\n\nCoring procedures usually alter the fluid content of the reservoir rock during the coring process.Drilling fluid is jetted against the formation rock ahead of the coring bit and the core surface as it enters the core barrel;as a result of this flushing action by the drilling mud filtrate,most free gas and a portion of the liquid are displaced from the core.When water base drilling fluid is used,the mud filtrate may displace oil until a condition of residual oil saturation is obtained.Also,this flushing action may result in the fluid content of the core being predominately that of the drilling fluid.When oil base drilling fluid is used,the core sample that is obtained may be driven to an irreducible water saturation."}
{"text": "In particular,drastic differences may be observed in reser- voirs that contain both sandstone and carbonate oil-bearing strata."}
{"text": "Conventional core samples have oil content determined by atmospheric distillation.The oil distilled from a sample is collected in a calibrated receiving tube where the volume is measured.Temperatures up to 1,200°F(about 650℃)are used to distill the oil from the sample which causes some coking and cracking of the oil and the loss of a small portion of the oil.An empirically derived correction is applied to the observed volume to compensate for the loss.Calibration tests are made on each type of oil."}
{"text": "Whole core samples have oil content determined by vacuum distillation.This technique is used to remove oil from the sample without destroying the minerals of the sample.A maximum temperature of 450°F is used.The oil distilled from the sample is collected in a calibrated receiving tube which is immersed in a cold bath of alcohol and dry ice at about -75℃.This prevents the oil from being drawn into the vacuum system.As in the atmospheric distillation method,corrections must be applied to the measured volumes."}

Shales are composed of clay minerals.The type and amount of different clay minerals,which vary widely between shales,can affect their bulk properties."}
{"text": "5.2.3.2.5 Permeability\n\nPermeability is one of the essential properties used in eval- uation of a potentially producing formation.Unfortunately there are no logging devices that read permeability.This is because permeability is a dynamic property.Most logging tools spend only a few seconds in front of any one point of a formation,therefore it is impossible to measure any time-dependent parameter.There are methods to estimate permeability from well logs,but they are based on general assumptions.From a practical standpoint,log parameters only provide an\"order of magnitude\"approximation.Sev- eral methods of inferring permeability with well logs are discussed where applicable in each section."}

{"text": "In salt muds,the microlaterolog and micro spheri- cally focused log(MSFL)are used for Rxo readings.The microlaterolog is a focused tool with a shallower depth of investigation than the proximity log.For this reason, the microlaterolog is very strongly affected by mudcakes thicker than 3in.It is presented in tracks 2 and 3 like the proximity log.The MSFL is the most common Rxo tool for salt muds.It is a focused resistivity device that can be combined with the dual laterolog,thus providing three simultaneous resistivity readings.Although the depth of investigation is only a few inches,the tool can tolerate reasonably thick mudcakes 3in.The tool is also available in a slim-hole version.The only disadvantage to this device is that the pad can be easily damaged in rough boreholes."}
{"text": "5.2.3.4.13 Interpretation\n\nThe saturation of the flushed zone can be found from Equation 5.2.20.Rmf must be at formation temperature. Moveable hydrocarbons can be found by comparing Sxoand Sw.If Sw/Sxo<0.7 then the hydrocarbons in the formation are moveable (this is also related to fluid permeability)."}
{"text": "5.2.3.4.14 Gamma Ray Logs\n\nThe gamma ray log came into commercial use in the late 1940s.It was designed to replace the SP in salt muds and in air-filled holes where the SP does not work.The gamma ray tool measures the amount of naturally occurring radio- activity in the formation.In general,shales tend to have high radioactivity while sandstone,limestone,dolomite,salt, and anhydrite have low radioactivity.There are exceptions, where tools have been designed to separate gamma rays into their respective elemental sources,potassium(K),thorium (Th),and uranium(U)."}
{"text": "5.2.3.4.17 Sonic(Acoustic)Log\n\nThe sonic(acoustic or velocity)total measures the time it takes for acompressional wave to travel through one vertical foot of formation.It can be used to determine porosity(if the lithology is known)and to determine seismic velocities for geophysical surveys when combined with a density log.The sonic log also has numerous cased hole applications."}
{"text": "5.2.3.4.18 Theory\n\nA 20kHz sound wave is produced by the tool and travels through the mud into the formation.The wave travels vertically through the formation.The first arrival of the compressional wave is picked up by a received about one foot away from the transmitter.The wave continues through the formation and is picked up by the far receiver(normally 2-ft below the near receiver).The time difference between the near and far receivers is used to determine formation travel time(△t).Fractures,vugs,unconsolidated forma- tions,gas-cut mud,lost circulation materials,and rough boreholes can cause sharp increases in △t,called cycle skips."}

{"text": "The sonic porosity derived from the Wyllie equation (Equation5.2.23)does not include secondary porosity(vugs and fractures),so it must be cautiously applied in carbonate rocks."}
{"text": "5.2.3.4.20 Density Log\n\nThe formation density tool measures the bulk electron density of the formation and relates it to porosity.It is a pad device with a caliper arm.The tool is usually run in combination with a neutron log,but it can be run alone."}

{"text": "5.2.3.4.27 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(NMR)\n\nThis log examines the nucleus of certain atoms in the for- mation.Of particular interest are hydrogen nuclei(protons) since these particles behave like magnets rotating around each other [23].Hydrogen is examined because it occurs in both water and hydrocarbons."}
{"text": "The log measures fluid by applying a magnetic field, greater in intensity than the earth field,to the formation. Hydrogen protons align themselves with the induced field and when the field is suddenly removed,the protons precess about the earth's magnetic field much like a gyroscope. The nucleus of hydrogen has a characteristic precession rate called the Larmor frequency(~2,100Hz),and can be identified by sensors on the tool [24].The nuclei contribut- ing to the total signal occur in the free fluid in the pores; fluid adsorbed on the grains makes no contribution.The signals are then processed in a computer and printed out onto a log."}

{"text": "Since the wave is attenuated by water (and is not too bothered by oil),the log response indicates either Rxo(in water-based mud systems)or bulk volume water (in oil- based mud systems)."}
{"text": "The depth of investigation of the tool varies between one and three inches and depends on formation conductivity; high conductivity reduces depth of investigation."}
{"text": "The tool is affected primarily by hole roughness(rugos- ity)and mud cakes>3in.thick.These effects reduce depth of investigation and in extreme situations(i.e.,very rough 1holes and/or very thick mud cakes)keep the tool from reading the formation at all."}
{"text": "tested on the trip into the hole.Once the drawdown pressure and the pressure buildup have been recorded,they can be processed by a computer at the well-site to provide Horner plots from which permeabilities are calculated.Permeabil- ities from the drawdown test often vary considerably from measured permeabilities and should be considered an order- of-magnitude estimate.This is usually due to a very shallow depth of investigation associated with drawdown tests [33]. The pressure buildup has a better depth of investigation than the drawdown pressure test.Accuracy depends on what type of pressure-wave propagation model is chosen [33],[35],[36]]as well as the compressibility and viscosity of the formation fluids."}
{"text": "5.2.3.5.4 Cased Hole Logs\n\nCased hole logs are run to evaluate reservoir performance, casing/cement bond quality,and to check flow rates from producing intervals.The reader is referred to Bateman's book [38]on cased hole logging which provides a more detailed discussion than is possible in this summary."}
{"text": "Cased hole logs can be broadly divided into two classes:\n\n1.Logs that measure formation parameters through the casing."}
{"text": "2.Logs that measure the parameters within and immedi- ately adjacent to the casing."}
{"text": "These logs are all combined to monitor fluids being produced,monitor reservoir performance,and monitor producing-string deterioration with time.They differ from open-hole logs in that the majority of cased hole logs merely monitor fluid production rather than provide extensive data on formation characteristics."}
{"text": "Following recent developments in cased hole logging technology,the following measurements can be made:\n\n● Formation resistivity through casing:Although the concept of measuring resistivity through casing is not new,but it is only recent break throughs in downhole electronics and electrode design that have made the measurements possible [Schlumberger tool: CHFR]."}
{"text": "● Formation porosity through casing:Measurements are based on an electronic neutron source instead of a chem- ical source,and it uses borehole shielding and focusing to obtain porosity measurements that are affected only minimally by borehole environment,casing standoff, and formation characteristics such as lithology and salinity [Schlumberger tool:CHFP]."}
{"text": "● Formation accoustics:This technique measures forma- tion compressional and shear slowness in cased wells [Schlumberger tool:DSI]."}

{"text": "The main problem with using these logs is the presence of shale.Shale normally appears wet,and shale willmake a reservoir look like it has higher Sw.Openhole logs and an NGS log are needed to confirm this interpretation although shaly sand corrections can easily be made [38]."}
{"text": "5.2.3.5.11 Gamma Spectroscopy Tools(GST)\n\nAlso known as the carbon-oxygen log,this device has been incorporated into pulsed neutron tools to aid in differentiat- ing oil and gas from water.GST tools operate with the same neutron generator as the pulsed neutron devices,but gamma rays returning from the formation are measured."}
{"text": "Two types of gamma rays are produced when neutrons are fired into a formation:\n\n1.Those that result from neutron capture by chlorine and boron."}
{"text": "2.Those that result from inelastic collisions with atoms."}

{"text": "3.Thin cement sheaths,caused by excessive mud cake thickness along a permeable formation,are a prob- lem when cement sheaths are less than³in.thick (which allows stronger casing arrivals).At times,the cement and formation have a slight acoustic cou- pling which gives the VDL a faint or weak formation signal."}
{"text": "casing and the cement.This can also occur if excessive pipe dope or varnish is present on the pipe.Microannulus due to pressurization primarily occurs opposite washed out portions ofthe borehole."}
{"text": "Channeling occurs when cement is in the annulus but does not completely surround,or is not bonded to,the pipe. This condition will not have proper fluid seal which allows oil,gas or water to pass up the hole outside the casing. Microannulus,on the other hand,may have a proper seal even though a small gap exists.It is very important to be able to distinguish between microannulus and channeling; squeezing may eliminate the channel altogether."}

{"text": "5.2.3.5.21 Electrical Potential Logs\n\nSimilar in some respects to an SP log,this tool measures the potential gradient of a DC current circulating through a string of casing.This current is applied to provide the casing with cathodic protection thereby preventing casing corro- sion;any deviation from a negative field suggests that the pipeis not receiving proper protection and is probably being corroded.Combined with an electromagnetic inspection log,areas currently undergoing corrosion as well as having a relative amount of damage can be determined with ease."}
{"text": "These logs can be run singly or in combination on a production combination tool so that a number of parameters may be recorded on the same log sheet."}
{"text": "5.2.3.5.24 Temperature Log\n\nA thermometer is used to log temperature anomalies pro- duced by the flow or fluid inside the casing or in the casing annulus.It is used to help determine flow-rates and points of fluid entry or exit,and is,perhaps,most useful for finding fluid movement behind the casing."}
{"text": "5.2.3.5.22 Borehole Televiewers\n\nThis tool incorporates an array of transmitters and receivers to scan the inside of the casing.The signals are sent to the surface where they are analyzed and recorded in a format that gives a picture of the inside of the casing.Any irregularities or cracks in the pipe are clearly visible on the log presentation.This allows engineers to fully scan older pipe and get an idea of the kind and extent of damage that might not otherwise be readable from multifinger caliper, electromagnetic inspection,or electrical potential logs.The main drawback to this device is that it must be run in a liquid-filled hole to be effective."}

{"text": "Gradiomanometers are used to check the difference in pressure over a 2-in.interval in a producing well.This is then related to water-holdup in polyphase fluid flow within the casing."}
{"text": "Another log similar to the gradiomanometeris the water- holdup meter.The main limitation is that it only reads water holdup and cannot be used if water is not present.It has the advantage over the gradiomanometer where sensitivity is required;small differences in density may not be seen by the gradiomanometer."}

{"text": "Fluid velocity is measured by velocity-shot analysis.A shot of radioactive fluid is injected into the flow stream above two detectors located on a stationary mammary tool. As the radioactive pulse moves down the hole,the amount of time required to move past the two detectors is measured."}
{"text": "The main limitation is that slippage and water-holdup factors seriously affect the time reading so this technique cannot be applied in production wells.Moreover,the pro- duction of radioactive material is not desirable;therefore, use is mainly restricted to water-or gas-injection wells [42]."}
{"text": "After the well has been shut in for a period of time (usually at least 24 to 72 hours or longer depending on reservoir characteristics),the well is put on production at a low rate with a small choke.The rate of production is recorded as a function of flow time.When the production rate has stabilized,the flow rate is increased by increasing the choke,and flow rate is monitored with time.This process is repeated until a series of measurements has been recorded[19]."}

{"text": "Single-well tests such as buildup,falloff,drawdown, injection,and variable-rate describe the isotropic reservoir adjacent to the test well while multiple well tests such as long term interference or short term pulse describe the characteristics between wells.Buildup and falloff tests are most popular because the zero flow rate is readily held con- stant.Drawdown and injection tests are run less frequently due to problems with maintaining a constant rate.Variable rate tests are useful when wellbore storage is a problem. Multiwell testing for characterizing anisotropic reservoirs has been popularized by the increased use of sophisticated simulation software."}
{"text": "5.3.1 Definitions and Concepts\n\nSeveral excellent references on well test analyses are avail- able [1.13,1.66],and a good discussion of difficulties in interpretation of data is available in a recent text.From information in these references several definitions will be given,and the basic concepts of well test analysis willbe summarized.More advanced concepts can be found in the foregoing references or in the extensive literature on this subject that has appeared in recent years."}
{"text": "on both linear and semilog plots.In the transient region,the reservoir is infinite-acting,and the flowing bottomhole pres- sure is a linear function of log△t.This region is amenable to analysis by transient methods,and occurs for radial flow at flow times up toapproximatelyt=φμcr²/0.00264k,where field units are used:t is time in hours,φis porosity as a fraction,μ is viscosity in cp,c is compressibility in psi-¹, re is the external radius in ft,and k is permeability in md [1.13]."}
{"text": "5.3.1.1.4 Steady-State Flow\n\nAt a constant flow rate for steady-state flow,the pressure at every point in the reservoir will remain constant with time.This condition is rarely encountered in most welltest analyses;steady-state flow may be approached in reservoirs with strong water drives or in cases where reservoir pressure is maintained by gas injection or waterflooding."}
{"text": "5.3.1.1.7 Falloff Tests\n\nPressure falloff tests are conducted in injection wells and are analogous to the pressure buildup tests in producers.A falloff test consists of(1)injecting fluid at a constant rate, (2)shutting in the well,and (3)recording the decrease in pressure.As long as the mobility ratio between the injected fluid and in-situ fluids is near unity,the analysis of pressure transient tests in injection wells is relatively simple.The equations used in producing well tests are applicable with the exception that the flow is taken to be negative for injection whereas flow is positive for production."}
{"text": "5.3.1.2 Concepts\n\nMost techniques used in the analysis of transient tests assume a single well operating at a constant flow rate in an infinite reservoir.At early times,a well transient is like a single well in an infinite reservoir,but at late times,effects of other wells aquifers,or reservoir boundaries can cause the pressure behavior to deviate from the infinite-acting assumption.Other common assumptions include:horizontal flow,negligible gravity effects,a single fluid of small and constant compressibility,a homogeneous and isotropic porous medium,the Darcy equation is obeyed,and several parameters (including porosity,permeability,viscosity,and compressibility)are independent of pressure."}
{"text": "Middle-time data will plot as a straight line on semilog- arithmic paperThe slope and the intercept of the MTR straight line are used to calculate reservoir permeability, skin factor,and average reservoir pressure.Semilogarithmic straight lines can occur in the ETR and the use of their slopes and intercepts results in unrealistic reservoir charac- teristics.Typically,improper use of injection well ETR data indicates a tight,fractured reservoir while use of producing wellETR data indicates damaged permeable rock when that is not at all the case."}
{"text": "Flow conditions in the pseudosteady-state LTR occur when transients reach the no-flow drainage boundary dur- ing producing-well transient-tests.Flow conditions in the steady-state LTR occur when transients reach the constant pressure boundary in secondary recovery operations.The slope of a Cartesian plot of an LTR drawdown can be useful in determining reservoir limits.Care should be taken to ensure that LTR data are not included in the MTR analysis."}
{"text": "test period and since zero is an easy constant flow rate to maintain,wellbore storage is afrequent problem.The length of the storage period is increased by skin damage since damage acts as an area of reduced permeability around the wellbore."}

{"text": "Use of the logarithmic data plot to determine the start of the semilogarithmic straight line of course means that the ETR data must be recorded.Pressure changes need to be monitored by the minute and bottomhole pressure at the time of shut-in must be precisely determined.Occasionally a great deal of emphasis is placed on the accuracy of the pressure-measuring equipment when the emphasis should be on the clock."}

{"text": "At initial conditions,hydrocarbon fluids in a reservoir may exist as a single phase or as two phases.The single phase may be a gas phase or a liquid phase in which all of the gas present is dissolved in the oil.When there are hydrocarbons vaporized in the gas phase which are recoverable as liquids at the surface,the reservoir is called gas-condensate,and the produced liquids are referred to as condensates or distillates.For two-phase accumulations, the vapor phase is termed the gas cap and the underlying liquid phase is called the oil zone.In the two-phase ease, recovery of hydrocarbons includes the free gas in the gas cap,gas evolving from the oil (dissolved gas),recoverable liquid from the gas cap,and crude oil from the oil zone.If an aquifer or region of high water saturation is present,a transition zone can exist in which the water saturation can vary as a function of vertical depth and formation perme- ability.Water that exists in the oil-or gas-bearing portion of the reservoir above the transition zone is called connate or interstitial water.All of these factors are important in the evaluation of the hydrocarbon reserves and recovery efficiency."}

{"text": "A plot of p/z versus Gpmay not be a straight line for several reasons:an unexpected water drive may exist,aver- age reservoir pressure may be inaccurate,or the reservoir pore volume may be changing unpredictably as a result of abnormally high reservoir pressures [2.18].A water drive reduces relative permeability to gas and increases pressure at abandonment [2.1].For reservoirs at moderate to high pressure in the absence of a water drive,the recovery efficiency under pressure depletion may range from about 80%to more than 90%;a water drive can reduce recovery to about 60%.To maximize efficiency,water-bearing zones should not be perforated if the water is movable,and production should be at a high rate since water entry is time dependent[2.1]."}
{"text": "described earlier,recovery may be caused by solution gas drive,water drive,gas cap drive,or a combination of these mechanisms.A general material balance equation should be capable of handling any type of fluid distribution and any drive mechanism."}
{"text": "For a reservoir with no initial free gas saturation or no initial gas cap,G=0.If there is no water encroachment, We=0;however,the water production term should remain, even if there is no water drive,because connate water may be produced when the reservoir pressure declines."}
{"text": "When a reservoir contains free gas,the pore volume expansion or compressibilities of the formation and water are insignificant compared to the free gas terms.Since the gas compressibility is about 100 times the compressibility of the water and formation,a gas saturation of only 1% may provide as much energy as the water and formation compressibility terms.Thus,when the gas saturation is substantial the change in pore volume is insignificant."}

{"text": "5.7.1.1.5 Improved Recovery\n\nThis includes all methods for supplementing natural reser- voir forces and energy,or otherwise increasing ultimate recovery from a reservoir.Such recovery techniques include (1)pressure maintenance,(2)cycling,and (3)secondary recovery in its original sense (i.e.,fluid injection applied relatively late in the productive history of a reservoir for the purpose of stimulating production after recovery by primary methods of flow or artificial lift has approached an economic limit).Improved recovery also includes the enhanced recovery methods of thermal,chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids."}
{"text": "Reserve estimates are based on interpretation of geo- logic and/or engineering data available at the time of the estimate.Existing economic conditions are prices,costs, and markets prevailing at the time of the estimate.Other assumed future economic conditions may lead to different estimates of recoverable volumes;these volumes are not considered reserves under existing economic conditions constraints,but may be identified as resources."}
{"text": "Natural gas reserves are those volumes which are expected to be produced and that may have been reduced by onsite usage,by removal of nonhydrocarbon gases, condensate or natural gas liquids."}
{"text": "Reserves may be attributed to either natural reservoir or improved recovery methods.Improved recovery includes all methods for supplementing natural reservoir energy to increase ultimate recovery from a reservoir.Such methods include(1)pressure maintenance,(2)cycling,(3)water- flooding,(4)thermal methods,(5)chemical flooding,and (6)the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids Reserves attributed to improved recovery methods usually will be distinguished from those attributed to primary recovery\n\nAll reserve estimates involve some degree of uncer- tainty,depending chiefly on the amount and reliability of geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves in one of two classifications,either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be subclassified as probable or possible to denote progressively increasing uncertainty."}
{"text": "Reserves that can be produced through the application of established improved recovery methods are included in the proved classification when:(1)successful testing by a pilot project or favorable production or pressure response of an installed program in that reservoir,or one in the immediate area with similar rock and fluid properties,provides support for the engineering analysis on which the projector program is based and (2)it is reasonably certain the project will proceed."}

{"text": "5.7.1.2.2 Unproved Reserves\n\nThese are based on geologic and/or engineeringdata similar to that used in estimates of proved reserves,but techni- cal,contractual,or regulatory uncertainties preclude such reserves being classified as proved.Estimates of unproved reserves may be made for internal planning of special evaluations,but are not routinely complied."}

{"text": "5.7.2.1 Analogy\n\nThe decision to drill a well is based upon the potential reserves that it will recover.This means that an engineer must be able to predict reserves before a well is drilled. The lack of information about the reservoir restricts the engineering methods available."}
{"text": "Analogy is the only method which can be used without specific well information such as porosity,reservoir thick- ness,and water saturation.Because analogy employs no specific information about a well,it is the least accurate method of determining reserves.Methods of analogous reserve determination depend on the proximity of similar reserves.The best analogy can be made by taking the median ultimate recovery of a number of wells that are closest and have the same formation and characteristics expected in the proposed well.When ultimate recovery data are not available,volumetric,decline curve or other methods of estimating ultimate recovery may be used."}

{"text": "5.8.2 Gas Injection\n\nHistorically,both natural gas and air have been used in gas injection projects,and in some cases nitrogen and flue gases have been injected.Many of the early gas injection projects used air to immiscibly displace crude oil from reservoirs.The injection of hydrocarbon gas may result in either a miscible or immiscible process depending on the composition of the injected gas and crude oil displaced, reservoir pressure,and reservoir temperature.Hydrocarbon miscible injection is considered as an enhanced recovery process and is discussed later."}
{"text": "Although the ultimate oil recovered from immiscible gas injection projects will normally be lower than for waterflooding,gas injection may be the only alternative for secondary recovery under certain circumstances.If per- meability is very low,the rate of water injection may be so low that gas injection is preferred.In reservoirs with swelling clays,gas injection may be preferable.In steeply- dipping reservoirs,gas that is injected updip can very efficiently displace crude oil by a gravity drainage mech- anism;this technique is very effective in low-permeability formations such as fractured shales.In thick formations with little dip,injected gas (because of its lower density) will tend to override and result in vertical segregation if the vertical permeability is more than about 200 md [5.8]. In thin formations especially if primary oil production has been by solution-gas drive,gas may be injected into a number of wells in the reservoir on a well pattern basis; this dispersed gas injection operation attempts to bank the oil in a frontal displacement mechanism.In addition to the external gas injection into reservoirs with dip as just described(which may be into a primary or secondary gas cap),a variation called attic oil recovery involves injection of gas into a lower structural position.If there is sufficient vertical permeability,the injected gas will migrate upward to create a secondary gas cap that can displace the oil downward where it is recovered in wells that are already drilled."}
{"text": "5.8.3 Water Injection\n\nWater injection processes may be designed to:(1)dispose of brine water,(2)conduct a pressure maintenance project to maintain reservoir pressure when expansion of an aquifer or gas cap isinsufficient to maintain pressure,or(3)implement a water drive or waterflood of oil after primary recovery. As mentioned before,waterflooding is the dominant sec- ondary recovery process which accounts for about 50% of the current oil production in U.S.operations.Because of the importance of waterflooding,fluid displacement in waterflooded reservoirs is covered as a separate discussion in a later section."}
{"text": "In many parts of the United States,40-acre spacing or less is common for oil wells,and 160-acre or 320-acre spacing is common for gas wells.Because drilling costs increase considerably with depth,deeper wells may be on larger spacing."}
{"text": "Inverted:One injection well per pattern."}
{"text": "For the 7-spot and 9-spot patterns,the distinction between normal and inverted patterns is more important."}
{"text": "Pattern selection is important because it can affect the area swept by the injected fluid.Areal or pattern sweep efficiency is discussed in the section under fluid movement in waterflooded reservoirs,but the principles apply to either water or gas injection."}
{"text": "The importance of various factors that affect displace- ment of oil by water were discussed in the first section. In particular,the discussion on the effect of wettability on relative permeability characteristics is important in the understanding of oil displacement during waterflooding."}
{"text": "5.9.1 Displacement Mechanisms\n\nUnder ideal conditions,water would displace oil from pores in a rock in a piston-like manner or at least in a manner representing a leaky piston.However,because of various wetting conditions,relative permeabilities of water and oil are important in determining where flow of each fluid occurs,and the manner in which oil is displaced by water In addition,the higher viscosity of crude oil in comparison to water will contribute to nonideal displacement behavior. Several concepts will be defined in order that an understand- ing of displacement efficiencies can be achieved."}
{"text": "OOIP:Original oil-in-place\n\nB/NAF:Barrels per net acre-ft."}
{"text": "Areal sweep efficiency is more important for consid- ering rate vs.time behavior of a waterflood rather than ultimate recovery because,at the economic limit,most of the interval flooded has either had enough water throughout to provide 100%areal sweep or the water bank has not yet reached the producing well so that no correction is needed for areal sweep[1.133]."}
{"text": "where Ev is the volumetric sweep efficiency in a linear displacement,Va is the displaceable pore volumes injected, and the other terms are as already defined."}
{"text": "5.9.9 Permeability Variation\n\nTwo methods of quantitatively defining the variation in ver- tical permeabilities in reservoirs are commonly used.The extent of permeability stratification is sometimes described with the Lorenz coefficient [18]and is often described with the Dykstra-Parsons [19]coefficient of permeability variation."}
{"text": "These equations are valid for mobility ratios ranging from 0 to 10 and for permeability variations ranging from 0.3 to 0.8."}
{"text": "A recent analytical extension [24]of the Dykstra- Parsons method allows calculations of total flow rates and flow rates in each layer for both a constant injection rate and for a constant pressure drop.The ability to calculate cumulative injection into a layer allows the incorporation of sweep efficiency of each layer as a function of mobility ratio and displaceable pore volumes injected for the pattern used in the waterflood."}
{"text": "Still at issue is the relative importance of mobility ratio and gravity in waterflooding stratified reservoirs [27-31]. For wetting conditions that are not strongly water-wet, additional complications will arise."}
{"text": "5.9.12 Performance Evaluation\n\nMonitoring waterflood performance is crucial to the success of the flood.From a reservoir engineering standpoint,the primary concerns are water injectivity and oil productivity. A few important factors related to these concerns will be summarized."}
{"text": "5.9.13.2 Monitoring Injectivity\n\nInjection well performance can be analyzed and monitored by several means.During and after a period of injection,the pressure transient methods discussed earlier can be used. Additionally,several bookkeeping methods of monitoring injection rates and pressures are quite useful."}
{"text": "slope of a plot of △p/qw versus the logarithm of cumulative water injected.However,the method can only be used during the initial injection period.After fill-up,△p/q,the reciprocal of injectivity index,will cease to be a function of cumulative water injected unless the well experiences damage or is stimulated.In these cases,the plots suggested by Hall [40]are convenient for analysis of the data."}
{"text": "5.9.13.3 Production Curves\n\nPlots of waterflood injection and production performance can be presented in a number of ways.For the history of the project,water injection rate,oil production rate,and water-oil ratio or water cut can be plotted vs.time(usually months).The actual water injection and oil production rates can be compared to the predicted rates on atime basis."}

{"text": "Many of the projects currently being evaluated as ter- tiary prospects were initially developed twenty to thirty years ago or longer.At that time,methods for estimat- ing hydrocarbon content were not as accurate as meth- ods presently available.In addition,adequate information relating to hydrocarbon volumes may be limited to only a few wells in a field and production data for the field may not always be reliable.In any event,even where material balance might yield a reasonable estimate of the amount of residual oil-in-place,it does not indicate the distribution of oil within the reservoir."}
{"text": "The value of (Sor)MB will be dependent on both the microscopic displacement efficiency in swept zones and the vertical and horizontal sweep efficiency.It has been suggested that a high ratio of (Sor)MB to Sor,determined by methods applying to the swept zone,indicates that the reservoir still contains an unusually high amount of oil in the unswept region.The reservoir should then receive special consideration as a candidate for obtaining additional oil recovery through infill drilling[1]."}
{"text": "In application of tertiary recovery,the residual oil remaining in the swept zone is of most interest because this is the region that will most likely be contacted by a tertiary process.Thus,the material balance,even in more sophisticated forms than the foregoing simple volumetric balance,should only be used for rough screening in evaluat- ing prospects for tertiary recovery.Furthermore,because of the many uncertainties in the measurements used to obtaina material balance,an enhanced recovery prospect should not be discounted on the basis of material balance alone."}
{"text": "When the volume of oil produced is known with reason- able precision,the accuracy of this method depends mainly on the reliability of the original oil-in-place estimate."}
{"text": "5.10.2.3 Applicability\n\nBecause of the rigid requirements of the assumptions made, and the problems with interpreting the field data,oil satura- tions obtained from well test analyses are considered rough estimates.The saturation estimate is an overall average for the region of the reservoir influenced by the test.If permeability variations or other conditions cause a variation in the vertical saturation distribution,these techniques will not yield meaningful data.For these techniques to be con- sidered for oil saturation determinations,good laboratory core analysis data are essential.However,because of the low costs and relative ease in conducting the tests,plus the additional important information obtained,well test analyses should be developed along with the other more direct methods of determining residual oil saturations."}
{"text": "Various techniques are used to obtain core samples:con- ventional diamond-bit coring,rubber-sleeve coring,pres- sure coring,sidewall coring,and recovery of cuttings gen- erated from the drilling operation.The last two methods are not used for residual oil measurements.Conventional coring is normally done in competent formations to obtain full-diameter cores.In unconsolidated,or poorly consoli- dated formation,a core barrel containing a rubber sleeve is used.The core sample is held together by the sleeve and its properties during laboratory tests remain reasonably representative of conditions in the formation [4]."}
{"text": "Two main problems in coring for determination of residual oil are that further flushing of oil to below-normal waterflood residual can take place around the core bit,and that loss of oil occurs,due mainly to gas expansion,as the core is lifted to the surface."}
{"text": "5.10.3.1.2 Overbalance Pressure\n\nUnintentional displacement of residual oil may occur in coring operations when large pressure gradients exist near the core bit.In this region when fluid velocities are high,the resulting viscous forces may become sufficient to overcome the capillary forces that hold the residual oil in place."}
{"text": "5.10.3.1.3 Drilling Mud Properties\n\nAt bottomhole conditions,API filter loss for water-base muds is often in the range of 5 to 10cc for 30 minutes, which is sufficient to drive most3-in.to 4-in.diameter cores to the equivalent of the waterflood residual oil saturation if the region being cored is not already at this condition [1.123].Higher mud water loss or smaller core diameters can lead to displacement of some of this residual oil. However,only general agreement has been found between API filter loss and the amount of oil stripped from cores. More consistent agreement has been observed between the amount of mobilized residual oil and spurt loss(the rapid fluid loss to the formation that occurs before an effective mud filter cake has built up).Spurt loss has been shown to correlate with solids content and particle size distribution which also influence filtration rates and amount of oil- stripping [2.16].In general,when taking cores it is always preferable to use a bland water base drilling fluid which contains no oil or surface active materials [1]."}
{"text": "5.10.3.1.4 Shrinkage and Bleeding\n\nIn reservoirs which have been depleted to low pressures and waterflooded to high water-oil ratios,changes in residual saturation in bringing the core to the surface should be fairly minimized.However,in most cases,as the core is raised, gases will come out of solution and can cause residual oil to bleed from the core.The loss of gas causes the oil to shrink."}
{"text": "5.10.3.1.5 Corrections for Shrinkage and Bleeding Shrinkage of residual oil can be estimated from laboratory measurements of shrinkage when the pressure of bottom- hole oil samples is lowered.Reduction of temperature will also contribute to shrinkage.The following corrections have been proposed for the effects of shrinkage and bleeding [1.123]."}
{"text": "5.10.3.1.6 Pressure Core Barrel\n\nConsiderable development work has gone into developing a core barrel that will bring cores to the surface without major reduction in reservoir pressure,and thus prevent shrinkage and bleeding.The pressure core barrel is designed to cut the core and seal it within a cylinder before retrieval.Although the cores obtained are small in diameter pressure coring has gained acceptance as one of the best methods of determining residual oil,particularly when information on the vertical profile of the oil saturation is wanting.Success in application of the core barrel depends to a great extent on the skill and experience of the personnel running the operation.The main criterion for success is retrieving cores at or close to formation pressure.Improvements over the years have led to the present success level of about 70%to 80%in consolidated formations [2.3,1,8-13]."}
{"text": "5.10.3.1.7 Sponge Cores\n\nA recent modification [14]to a conventional core barrel is the incorporation of a porous sponge to collect oil that bleeds from the core.The oil saturation measured by conventional techniques is corrected for the bleeding of oil as measured in the sponge.Oil saturations measured with this technique have approximated the values determined by pressure coring but at a cost that is closer to conventional coring."}
{"text": "5.10.3.2.1 Core Handling\n\nConventional Cores.The precautions taken in handling cores once they have been recovered depends mainly on the measurements and tests that are to be performed on them.If the measurements are routine and can be run within a day or two,it is generally considered sufficient to wipe the cores,wrap them in plastic and protect them from exposure to the sun.However,it is better to keep the wrapped cores inside ice boxes to minimize evaporation, especially when longer transit times are anticipated.When maintenance of wettability conditions as they exist in the reservoir is attempted,the most widely preferred method of preservation is to wrap the core in thin sheets of plastic followed by aluminum foil and then isolate the wrapped core from the atmosphere by a coating of wax or plastic. An alternative method of preservation is to store the cores in deoxygenated aqueous solution.This may be formation brine,synthetic brine or mud filtrate [1,15]."}
{"text": "5.10.3.2.2 Pressure Cores\n\nSpecial handling is needed for cores obtained using the pressure core barrel.This is normally carried out by the trained crew which assembled the barrel prior to testing. After retrieving the core barrel,drilling fluid is displaced at pressure by gelled kerosene.The complete barrel is then chilled in dry ice for several hours in order to freeze the water in the core sample.The pressure in the core barrel can then be released and an inner metal sleeve containing the core is removed.The core is cut into convenient lengths,of about three to four feet,and kept frozen by means of dry ice during transportation[1]."}
{"text": "5.10.3.2.3 Measurement of Residual Oil in Recovered Cores\n\nVarious techniques are available for determining the oil content of cores.Examples that involve removal of the oil are vacuum distillation,a combination of distillation and solvent extraction (Dean Stark),and high temperature retorting.The Dean Stark method with toluene as solvent is normally used when displacement tests are to be carried out on the extracted cores.In this method,the oil saturation is determined by difference from the amount of water removed from the core[2.12,15,16]."}
{"text": "5.10.3.2.4 Residual Oil from Laboratory Core Floods\n\nMost cores are subjected to cleaning before measurement of permeability and porosity.However,when the preservation of wetting properties is of main interest,displacement tests are run on the cores prior to cleaning."}
{"text": "Another approach to the problem ofreservoir wettability is the restored state method.Cleaned cores are saturated with reservoir brine or brine of similar composition.The brine is displaced by reservoir crude to an equivalent con- nate water saturation.Recontacting the reservoir rock with the reservoir crude is believed to result in adsorption of those components from the crude oil which determined the in-situ wettability and hence restore the system to its original wetting condition."}
{"text": "The condition where the reservoir has been flooded out and the oil is immobile is considered later,but the theory can also be applied where both oil and water are flowing, or where the water phase is immobile.If a formation containing residual oil is flooded with a bank of water containing a tracer which is mutually soluble in oil and water,part of the tracer will pass into the oil phase.If there is local equilibrium,the concentration of the tracer in the oil,Cto,is related to the concentration in the aqueous phase, Ctw,by the distribution coefficient,K₁ ."}
{"text": "The concentration of tracer in the oil together with the oil volume determines the fraction of tracer resident in the oil phase.Since oil volume is directly proportional to oil saturation,the rate at which a pulse of tracer concentration passes through the formation depends on the oil saturation in regions swept by the tracer."}
{"text": "Equilibration of the tracer between the residual oil and water following the tracer bank coupled with dispersion effects determines the shape of a peaked concentration dis- tribution of tracer.Ahead of the peak there is net movement of tracer into the residual oil.Behind the peak there is net movement of tracer molecules from the residual oil back into the water."}
{"text": "5.10.4.2 Single-Well Tracer Technique\n\nThe single-well or backflow tracer technique to determine residual oil saturation is a recent innovation.Patents[19,20] assigned to Exxon Production Research Company in 1971 described the injection of tracers to measure in-situ oil saturation at distances of typically 10 to 30 ft away from the wellbore of a producing well.The single-well tracer test overcomes many of the difficulties that,in general,make the two-well test impractical."}
{"text": "A desirable volume for the slug is 50-90 barrels per foot of formation.Injection and production rates may limit the size of test that can be conducted in a reasonable period of time.Primary tracer volumes have varied from 40- 1,000 barrels while total water volumes have ranged from 175-2,000 barrels [21-24].Primary tracer concentration has normally been between 0.5-1 volume percent.In an example given by Deans [20],500 barrels of 1%ethyl acetate and 0.5%methanol in brine is followed by 1,500 barrels of brine containing 0.5%methanol.These quantities are determined by simple volumetric balance based on the desired depth of invasion."}
{"text": "5.10.4.2.3 Reservoir Heterogeneity\n\nAlthough the tracer test samples a relatively large pore volume,results will be weighted towards the higher per- meability zones.However,this may not be a disadvantage because these zones will normally be swept preferentially by tertiary processes."}
{"text": "The single-well tracer method is not recommended for fractured reservoirs.Fractures cause nonradial flow,which results in tracer profiles that are almost impossible to simu- late [23].Severe permeability variations are also difficult to interpret.Where gross permeability variations exist,it may be necessary to conduct frequent injection profile tests to determine the intervals that are experiencing high-rate fluid flow [24]."}
{"text": "5.10.4.2.4 Loss of Tracer\n\nWhen the chemical tracer is injected into zones that do not subsequently produce fluids,tracer will be lost to the reservoir.In one field test,loss of tracer was estimated at 15%of the injected amount [21].Conversely,dilution of produced fluids by water from zones that did not receive tracer injection will also present interpretation problems. If high drift-rates cannot be controlled,the slug of water containing chemicals can move so far from the wellbore that tracer profiles may not be well defined.Drift-rate should be less than 1 ft/day [24]."}
{"text": "In some cases,it may not be practical to perform tests in wells with large intervals open or in wells with large holdup volumes in the wellbore.In such instances,well workovers may be required [22]."}
{"text": "With wells produced by gas lift,corrections are required to account for the loss of part of the more volatile tracers to the gas by stripping action in the wellbore.Tests conducted [23]with ethyl acetate in gas lift wells indicate a loss of about 30%.Appreciable gas accompanying crude oil lifted by other production methods may cause loss of tracer by stripping."}
{"text": "5.10.5 Geophysical Well Logging Techniques\n\nGeophysical well logging has the advantage of being an in- situ measurement and is able to give a continuous estimate of residual oil saturation versus depth [25,26].These fea- tures allow the calibration of the measurements in known water-saturated formations.A more detailed discussion of well logging is given earlier.An evaluation of logging tech- niques for measurement of Sor was provided by Fertl [26]."}
{"text": "2.Pulsed neutron capture.This name(PNC)covers logs commercially available such as the Dresser Atlas Neu- tron Lifetime Log(NLL)and the Schlumberger Thermal Decay Time(TDT).The PNC has the virtue of being useful in cased holes."}
{"text": "3.Carbon-oxygen.This measurement has the virtues of being directly sensitive to carbon and of working in cased holes."}
{"text": "4.Nuclear magnetism.This service is not routinely used but has the unique virtue of being sensitive only to formation fluids."}
{"text": "5.Dielectric constant.This service is now routine but is limited to open holes.Its main advantage over resistivity measurements is that water salinity need not be known."}
{"text": "It is often taken to be n=2.If cores or other logs are available,better estimates of n can be made."}
{"text": "Relations other than Equation 5.10.16 are required for carbonates and shaly sands [28,29]."}
{"text": "Resistivity measurements cannot be made in cased holes.This may explain the limited documentation of such methods for residual oil determination in the literature."}
{"text": "5.10.5.1.2 Pulsed-Neutron-Capture\n\nThe device used for this measurement periodically emits brief bursts of high energy neutrons.Between bursts these neutrons are rapidly reduced in energy and then more slowly absorbed by formation nuclei.It is the rate of this relatively slow absorption that is measured."}
{"text": "Upon neutron absorption most formation nuclei are left in high energy states that decay to ground states through the emission of a characteristic set of gamma rays.That is, the gamma rays emitted have various energies and numbers at these energies that are unique to the capturing nucleus. However,carbon does not participate in this process."}
{"text": "The gamma rays emitted above a fixed energy (the fixed energy used in commercial tools varies from 50 kev to 200 kev)are detected and counted as a function of time.The analysis of this counting rate yields the apparent thermal decay time or equivalently the apparent capture cross-section of the formation.The apparent cross-section can be corrected to true formation cross-section through computation.Certain modes of operation [30]can yield results requiring little or no correction."}
{"text": "The technique just outlined will suffer if Lw is small corresponding to low chloride concentration(below 30,000 parts per million).If Lw is unknown,it can be con- trolled by an initial water flush with water of known cross-section."}
{"text": "The most common practice has been to run a PNC log, inject fresh water,and run a second PNC log.Excellent results have been reported for initial water salinities in excess of 30,000 part per million."}
{"text": "5.10.5.1.3 Carbon-Oxygen\n\nThe oil industry has long sought a logging method that directly measures oil saturation.The carbon-oxygen(C/O) log is the most recent method in this continuing effort. Since the method is sensitive to formation carbon and since oil is largely carbon,the ideal result would yield directly formation oil content [2.39,2.40,36-39]."}
{"text": "The device has serious limitations.These include prob- lems with counting statistics,interfering gamma rays,car- bonate rocks,and perturbations caused by casing and bore- hole.Best results are obtained when the tool is stationary for several minutes to overcome counting statistics,and when the formation porosity and oil saturation are high. The measurement may be improved using log-flush-log techniques,but only a few efforts have been documented at this time [26]."}
{"text": "5.10.5.1.4 Nuclear Magnetism\n\nThis method has been thoroughly discussed in the litera- ture [40-42].The technique involves a polarization of the hydrogen magnetic moments via a large coil(3ft long and 3 in.in diameter)carrying a large direct current.The idea is to align the hydrogen magnetic moments along the field created by the coil.This field ideally is at right angles to the earth's magnetic field.After a few seconds(up to about four),this coil-produced field is reduced to zero as quickly as possible.The polarized hydrozen moment then processes about the earth's field at about 2,200Hz.This includes a voltage into the coil which is detected and processed to yield a measure of the total number of hydrogen nuclei in the formation fluid.This number or concentration is called the free fluid index(FFD.Since oil and water have about the same concentration of hydrogen nuclei,FFI is a measure of porosity as given by the fluid contributing to the signal."}
{"text": "The use of this measurement for Sor determination could also benefit from the log-inject-log procedure.For example, after logging initially,one could displace the water with a fluid having about the same dielectric constant as oil.A further flush with a fluid removing all oil and of known dielectric constant could be made."}
{"text": "Carbon-oxygen\n\nDepth of investigation ～2in."}
{"text": "These measurements are bulk measurements ofthe for- mation sampled.Thus,if there are heterogeneities due to fractures,permeability variations,etc.,these will result in errors for elemental volumes.However,since for example, a low permeability zone may not contribute to a tertiary recovery process,this feature of the measurements may be an asset rather than a liability."}
{"text": "5.10.5.3 Accuracy of Logging Methods\n\nThe estimated uncertainty in residual oil saturations from electric logs is 5%to 10%under optimum conditions and could easily exceed 10%under less favorable conditions [31].Accuracy of saturations derived from electric logs is generally in the range of±15 saturation percent [6],which is clearly inadequate for residual oil determinations."}
{"text": "From the laboratory measurements of the C/O ratio,it is known that the accuracy of this technique is poor when porosity is low [2.39].Oil saturation probably cannot be reliably determined at porosities less than 15%.However, even in a 30%porosity sand,the accuracy of oil saturation measurements would only be±12.5%.While this uncer- tainty could be reduced by taking repeated measurements at the same depth,stability of resolution may still be a problem."}
{"text": "With the pulsed-neutron-capture L-I-L technique,accu- racy of ±5%oil saturation is obtainable [31,34].For best results,the contrast in salinities of the two waters should be as great as possible.While this technique has been successfully used,a test in a 100%water saturated formation yielded oil saturations of 40%-60%[35].These obviously incorrect values may have resulted from incom- plete displacement of formation water close to the wellbore by the injected low salinity water."}
{"text": "Accuracy of the nuclear magnetism log depends largely on the signal-to-noise ratio which can be improved by making repeated readings.Newer versions of the NML tool have improvedsignal-to-noise characteristics.As with other log-inject-log techniques,the possibility of fluid drift in the formation should be considered.Fluid drift should not be sufficient to move injected paramagnetic ions away from the wellbore which would cause erroneously high values of Sor[31]."}
{"text": "5.10.6 Summary of Methods for Estimating Residual Oil\n\nEconomics of primary and secondary recovery processes are usually sufficiently attractive to permit considerable error in the estimation of recoverable reserves.However, for tertiary recovery the amount of oil remaining in a reservoir and its distribution must be known with reasonable confidence.Firstly,a reliable estimate of residual content is extremely important to technical evaluation of field tests. Secondly,the high front-end costs of tertiary processes are such that overestimates of residual oil saturation could have disastrous economic consequence.Thus,a well-planned effort to measure residual oil saturation is a necessity before any tertiary recovery application.Under favorable circumstances,accuracies of±2%of reservoir pore space can be achieved.In general,accuracies will not be this good, but values within±5%are considered necessary."}
{"text": "In addition to material balance,other estimates of residual oil from resistivity logs and laboratory waterflood tests may also be available.However,in general,none of the conventional methods of determining residual oil saturation—analysis of conventional cores,laboratory dis- placement tests,conventional logging,material balance— are considered sufficiently reliable in themselves.They can provide useful guides as to whether a tertiary prospect should be investigated further."}
{"text": "Over the past 15-20 years there has been increased field testing of a number of more sophisticated techniques: pressure coring,tracer tests,and the various types of log- inject-log procedures.These methods vary in the conditions under which they can be applied and the type of information they provide."}
{"text": "Pressure coring and the sponge core technique provide information on the vertical distribution of residual oil and also have the advantage that the core analysis procedures directly demonstrate the presence of oil.Because of the possibility of flushing,results may tend to be conservatively low.For pressure coring,the time taken to obtain results tends to be longer than other methods because of transporta- tion and the specialized core analysis work that is needed."}
{"text": "After determining residual oil,the extracted cores are used to obtain needed information on reservoir properties, in particular vertical heterogeneity,and they also can be used in laboratory displacement tests.The reduced diameter (~21zin.)of pressure cores compared to those obtained by conventional coring is a disadvantage with respect to making laboratory displacement studies.The use of the sponge coring technique has increased because of the lower coring costs,reduced analysis costs,and,since larger diam- eter cores are obtained,core plugs can be obtained for subsequent conventional or specialized core testing."}
{"text": "The tracer test samples about a half million times more pore volume than the pressure core barrel.Results with the tracer test will be conservatively low because they are usually weighted towards the more permeable zones,where residual oil will tend to be lower.On balance this is probably an advantage because these zones willalso tend to be swept more readily during a tertiary process.The tracer test can be used in old wells,but it is important that the well has not been fractured or stimulated severely."}
{"text": "5.10.7.1 Existing Wells\n\nConsiderable cost can be saved if first measurements can be made on existing,preferably watered-out,producing wells.These wells will usually be cased.Old resistivity logs and core analysis data may be of value in estimating oil distribution and related heterogeneity.For more accurate determination of residual oil,the tracer test should be run together with the pulsed neutron capture log.However careful consideration must first be given to the past history to the well.There is no reliable method for determining residual oil if the well has been fractured or subjected to excessive stimulation.Inadvertent fracturing could have occurred during stimulation.Various forms of acidizing can have serious effects on near-borehole rock properties.The operator must also be sure that any injected chemicals which could affect results are absent from the test region,and that the well is clean and can be put on injection."}

{"text": "5.11.2.1 Polymer-Augmented Waterflooding\n\nHigh mobility ratios cause poor displacement and sweep efficiencies,and result in early breakthrough of injected water.By reducing the mobility of water,water break- through can be delayed by improving the displacement, areal,and vertical sweep efficiencies;therefore more oil can be recovered at any given water cut.Thus,the ultimate oil recovery at a given economic limit may be 4%-10%higher with a mobility-controlled flood than with plain water. Additionally,the displacement is more efficient in that less injection water is required to produce a given amount of oil."}
{"text": "A properly sized polymer treatment may require the injection of 15%-25%of a reservoir pore volume;poly- mer concentrations may normally range from 250 to 2,000mg/L.For very large field projects,millions of pounds of polymer may be injected over a 1-2 year period of time; the project then reverts to a normal waterflood.The polymer flooding literature was reviewed in the late 1970s [13]. Recommendations on the design of polymer floods were made available by Martin [14]."}
{"text": "5.11.2.2.2 Crosslinked or Gelled Polymers\n\nSeveral methods are available for diverting the flow of water in reservoirs with high permeability zones or fracture systems.Some methods are only effective near the injection well while others claim the treatment can be effective at some depth into the reservoir.Both producing wells and injection wells can be treated."}
{"text": "One method is the aluminum citrate process which con- sists of the injection of a slug of HPAM polymer solution, aluminum ion chelated with citrate ion,and a second slug of polymer.Some of the polymer in the first slug adsorbs or is retained on the surfaces of the reservoir.The aluminum ion attaches to the adsorbed polymer and acts as a bridge to the second polymer layer.This sequence is repeated until the desired layering is achieved.The transport of aluminum ions through the reservoir may be a problem in certain cases, so the effects of the treatment may be limited to near the wellbore."}
{"text": "Another method is based on the reduction of chromium ions to permit the crosslinking of HPAM or XG polymer molecules.A polymer slug containing Cr+6 is injected followed by a slug of polymer containing a reducing agent.When the Cr+6 is reduced to Cr+3,a gel is formed with the polymer.The amount of permeability reduction is controlled by the number of times each slug is injected,the size of each slug,or the concentrations used.An alternate treatment involves placing a plain water pad between the first and second polymer slugs."}
{"text": "In another variation of the above two methods for HPAM,a cationic polymer is injected first.Since reservoir surfaces are often negatively charged,the cationic polymer is highly adsorbed.When the foregoing sequential treat- ments are injected,there is a strong attraction between the adsorbed cationic polymer and the anionic polymers that follow."}
{"text": "Polymer concentrations used in these variations are normally low,on the order of 250mg/L.With low molecular weight polymers or if a very stiff gel is desired,polymer concentrations of 1-1.5%are common.The type of poly- mers are similar to those used in conventional polymer flooding,but the products used for gelation command a higher price."}
{"text": "Methods have been developed,especially for fracture treatments,include Cr³+(acetate)-polyacrylamide,col- lordal silica,and resorcinol-formaldehyde."}
{"text": "5.11.2.3 Surfactant and Alkaline Flooding\n\nBoth alkaline flooding and surfactant flooding improve oil recovery by lowering the interfacial tension between crude oil and the displacing water.With alkaline flooding,the surfactants are generated in situ when the alkaline materials react with crude oil-this technique is normally only viable when the crude oil contains sufficient amount of organic acids to produce natural surfactants.Other possible mech- anisms with the caustic materials include emulsification of the oil and alteration in the preferential wettability of the reservoir rock."}
{"text": "With surfactant flooding,surface-active agents are mixed with other compounds (such as alcohol and salt) in water and injected to mobilize the crude oil.Polymer- thickened water is then injected to push the mobilized oil- water bank to the producing wells.Water-soluble polymers can be used in a similar fashion with alkaline flooding.For micellar/polymer flooding,the concentration of polymer used may be similar to the value given for polymer flooding, but the volume of polymer solution may be increased to 50%or more of a reservoir pore volume."}
{"text": "5.11.2.3.1 Alkaline Flooding\n\nAlkaline or caustic flooding consists of injecting aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide,sodium carbonate,sodium silicate or potassium hydroxide.The alkaline chemicals react with organic acids in certain crude oils to produce surfactants in situ that dramatically lower the interfacial tension between water and oil.The alkaline agents also react with the reservoir rock surfaces to alter wettability- either from oil-wet to water-wet,or vice versa.Other mechanisms include emulsification and entrainment of oil or emulsification and entrapment of oil to aid in mobility control.Since an early patent in the 1920s described the use of caustic for improved recovery of oil,much research and some field tests have been conducted.Slug size of the alkaline solution is often 10%-15%PV,concentrations of the alkaline chemical are normally 0.2%to 5%.Recent tests are using large amounts of relatively high concentrations. A preflush of fresh or softened water often precedes the alkaline slug,and a drive fluid (either water or polymer- thickened water)follows the alkaline slug."}
{"text": "5.11.2.3.2 Surfactant/Polymer Flooding\n\nSurfactant use for oil recovery is not a recent development. Patents in the late 1920s and early 1930s proposed the use of low concentrations of detergents to reduce the interfacial tension between water and oil.To overcome the slow rate of advance of the detergent,Taber [15]proposed very high concentrations(~10%)of detergent in aqueous solution."}
{"text": "During the late 1950s and early 1960s,several differ- ent present-day methods of using surfactants for enhanced recovery were developed.A review of these methods is beyond the scope of this chapter and is available in the literature [16-19].In some systems,a small slug(>about 5%PV)was proposed that included a high concentra- tion of surfactant(normally 5%-10%).In many cases,the microemulsion includes surfactant,hydrocarbon,water,an electrolyte(salt),and a cosolvent(usually an alcohol). These methods ordinarily used a slug (30%-50%PV)of polymer-thickened water to provide mobility control in dis- placing the surfactant and oil-water bank to the producing wells.The polymers used are the same as those discussed in the previous section.In most cases,low-cost petroleum sulfonates or blends with other surfactants have been used. Intermediate surfactant concentrations and low concentra- tion systems (low tension waterflooding)have also been proposed.The lower surfactant concentration systems may or may not contain polymer in the surfactant slug,but will utilize a larger slug(30%-100%PV)of polymer solution."}
{"text": "5.11.2.3.3 Alkaline/Surfactant/Polymer Flooding\n\nA recent development uses a combination of chemicals to lower process costs by lowering injection cost and reduc- ing surfactant adsorption.These mixtures,termed alkaline/ surfactant/polymer(ASP),permit the injection of larger slugs of injectant because of the lower cost."}
{"text": "Hydrocarbon miscible flooding can be subdivided fur- ther into three distinct methods,and field trials or extensive operations have been conducted in all of them.For LPG slug or solvent flooding,enriched (condensing)gas drive and high pressure(vaporizing)gas drive,a range of pressures (and therefore,depths)are needed to achieve miscibility in the systems."}
{"text": "5.11.3.2 Nitrogen and Flue Gas Flooding\n\nAs previously mentioned,nitrogen and flue gas (about 87%N2 and 12%CO₂)are sometimes used in place of hydrocarbon gases because of economics.Nitrogen also competes with CO₂in some situations for the same reason. The economic appeal of nitrogen stems not only from its lower cost on a standard Mcf basis,but also because its compressibility is much lower.Thus,for a given quantity at standard conditions,nitrogen will occupy much more space at reservoir pressures than CO₂or even methane at the same conditions.However,both nitrogen or flue gas are inferior to hydrocarbon gases(and much inferior to CO₂)from an oil recovery point of view.Nitrogen has a lower viscosity and poor solubility in oil and requires a much higher pressure to generate or develop miscibility.The increase in the required pressure is significant compared to methane and very large (4-5 times)when compared to CO₂.Therefore,nitrogen will not reduce the displacement efficiency too much when used as a chase gas for methane,but it can cause a signif- icant drop in the effectiveness of a CO₂flood if the reser- voir pressures are geared to the miscibility requirements for CO₂displacements.Indeed,even methane counts as a desirable \"light end\"or \"intermediate\"in nitrogen flooding, but methane is quite deleterious to the achievement of miscibility in CO₂flooding at modest pressures."}
{"text": "Part of the appeal of fireflooding comes from the fact that it uses the world's cheapest and most plentiful fluids for injection:air and water.However,significant amounts of fuel must be burned,both above the ground to compress the air,and below ground in the combustion process.Fortu- nately,the worst part of the crude oil is burned;the lighter ends are carried forward in advance of the burning zone to upgrade the crude oil."}
{"text": "majority of the field testing with this process has occurred in California,where many of the shallow,high-oil-saturation reservoirs are good candidates for thermal recovery.These reservoirs contain high-viscosity crude oils that are difficult to mobilize by methods other than thermal recovery."}
{"text": "In the steam drive process,steam is continuously intro- duced into injection wells to reduce the viscosity of heavy oil and provide a driving force to move the more mobile oil towards the producing wells.In typical steam drive projects, the injected fluid at the surface may contain about 80% steam and 20%water(80%quality)[6].When steam is injected into the reservoir,heat is transferred to the oil- bearing formation,the reservoir fluids,and some of the adjacent cap and base rock.As a result,some of the steam condenses to yield a mixture of steam and hot water flowing through the reservoir."}
{"text": "The steam drive may work by driving the water and oil to form an oil bank ahead of the steamed zone.Ideally this oil bank remains in front,increasing in size until it is produced by the wells offsetting the injector.However,in many cases, the steam flows over the oil and transfers heat to the oil by conduction.Oil at the interface is lowered in viscosity and dragged along with the steam to the producing wells. Recoverability is increased because the steam(heat)lowers the oil viscosity and improves oil mobility.As the more mobile oil is displaced the steam zone expands vertically, and the steam-oil interface is maintained.This process is energy-intensive since it requires the use of a signif- icant fraction (25%-40%)of the energy in the produced petroleum for the generation of steam."}
{"text": "In steamflooding,the rate of steam injection is initially high to minimize heat losses to the cap and base rock. Because of reservoir heterogeneities and gravity segregation of the condensed water from the steam vapor,a highly permeable and relatively oil-free channel often develops between injector and producer.Many times this channel occurs near the top of the oil-bearing rock,and much of the injected heat is conducted to the caprock as heat loss rather than being conducted to oil-bearing sand where the heat is needed.In addition,the steam cannot displace oil efficiently since little oil is left in the channel.Consequently,neither the gas drive from the steam vapor nor the convective heat transfer mechanisms work as efficiently as desired.As a result,injected steam will tend to break through prematurely into the offset producing wells without sweeping the entire heated interval."}
{"text": "Screening guides or criteria are among the first items considered when apetroleum engineer evaluates a candidate reservoir for enhanced oil recovery.A source often quoted for screening criteria is the 1976 National Petroleum Coun- cil (NPC)report on Enhanced Recovery [6],which was revised by the NPC in 1984 [7].Both reports list criteria for six enhanced recovery methods."}
{"text": "Some reservoir considerations apply to all enhanced recovery methods.Because drilling costs increase markedly with depth,shallow reservoirs are preferred,as long as all necessary criteria are met.For the most part,reservoirs that have extensive fractures,gross heterogeneities,thief zones,or are highly faulted should be avoided.Ideally relatively uniform reservoirs with reasonable oil saturations, minimum shale stringers,and good areal extent are desired."}
{"text": "Nevertheless,some EOR processes can be rejected quickly because of unfavorable reservoir or oil properties, so the use of preferred criteria can be helpful in select- ing methods that may be commercially attractive.If the criteria are too restrictive,some feasible method may be rejected from consideration.Therefore,the guidelines that are adopted should be sufficiently broad to encompass essentially all of the potential methods for a candidate reservoir\n\nFor convenience,brief descriptions of the eight most common enhanced recovery methods are provided in the following sections.These descriptions list the salient fea- tures of each method along with the important screening guides.A few general comments are offered here on the relative importance of some individual screening guides to the overall success of the various methods.In addition,we will make some observations on the method itself and its relationship to other enhanced recovery choices that may be available."}

{"text": "● Steamflooding is not normally used in carbonate reser- voirs."}
{"text": "The screening guidelines and a description of poly- mer flooding are contained earlier in Section“Polymer Flooding.\"Since the objective of polymer flooding is to improve the mobility ratio without necessarily making the ratio favorable,the maximum oil viscosity for this method is 100 or possibly 150cp.If oil viscosities are very high, higher polymer concentrations are needed to achieve the desired mobility control,and thermal methods may be more attractive.As discussed earlier,polymer flooding will not ordinarily mobilize oil that has been completely trapped by water;therefore,a mobile oil saturation of more than 10%is desired.In fact,a polymer flood is normally more effective when started at low producing water-oil ratios [31].Although sandstone reservoirs are usually preferred,several large polymer floods have been conducted in carbonate reservoirs.Lower-molecular-weight polymers can be used in reservoirs with permeabilities as low as 10md(and,in some carbonates,as low as 3md).While it is possible to manufacture even lower- molecular-weight polymers to inject into lower permeability formations,the amount of viscosity generated per pound of polymer would not be enough to make such products of interest.With current polymers,reservoir temperature should be less than 200°F to minimize degradation;this requirement limits depths to about 9,000ft.A potentially serious problem with polymer flooding is the decrease the injectivity which must accompany any increase in injection fluid viscosity.If the decreased injectivity is prolonged,oil production rates and project costs can be adversely affected. Injection rates for polymer solutions may be only40%-60% of those for water alone,and the reduced injectivity may add several million dollars to the total project costs.Other problems common to the commercial polymers are cited earlier."}
{"text": "5.11.5.11 Criteria for Thermal Methods\n\nFor screening purposes,steamflooding and fireflooding are often considered togetherIn general,combustion should be the choice when heat losses from steamflooding would be too great.In other words,combustion can be carried out in deeper reservoirs and thinner,tighter sand sections where heat losses for steamflooding are excessive.Screen- ing guides for in-situ combustion are given earlier in Section \"In-Situ Combustion.\"The ability to inject at high pressures is usually important so 500ft has been retained as the minimum depth,but a few projects have been done at depths of less than 500ft.Since the fuel and air consumption decrease with higher gravity oils,there is a tendency to try combustion in lighter oils if the fire can be maintained,but no projects have been done in reservoirs with oil gravities greater than 32°API[29]."}
{"text": "In summary,if all screening criteria are favorable,fire- flooding appears to be an attractive method for reservoirs that cannot be produced by methods used for the lighter oils.However,the process is very complicated and beset with many practical problems such as corrosion,erosion and poorer mobility ratios than steamflooding.Therefore,when the economics are comparable,steam injection is preferred to a combustion drive[4]."}
{"text": "Screening criteria for steamflooding are listed earlier in section \"Steamflooding\".Although steamflooding is com- monly used with oils ranging in gravity from 10°-25°API, some gravities have been lower,and there is recent interest in steamflooding light oil reservoirs.Oils with viscosities of less than 20cp are usually not candidates for steamflooding because waterfloodingis less expensive;the normal range is 100-5,000cp.A high saturation of oil-in-place is required because of the intensive use of energy in the generation of steam.In order to minimize the amount of rock heated and maximize the amount of oil heated,formations with high porosity are desired;this means that sandstones or unconsolidated sands are the primary target,although a steam drive pilot has been conducted in a highly fractured carbonate reservoir in France.The product of oil saturation times porosity should be greater than about 0.08 [26]."}

{"text": "5.11.6.1.3 Core Testing\n\nRoutine core analyses,such as porosity,permeability,rela- tive permeabilities,capillary pressure,and waterflood sus- ceptibility tests are normally done by service companies that specialize in these types of tests.Specialized core tests such as thin sections or scanning electron microscopy,are available to evaluate the relationship between pore structure and the process being considered.If required,stimulation or injectivity improvement measures can be recommended."}
{"text": "5.11.6.2 Polymer Testing\n\nThe desirability of adding polymers is determined by evalu- ating all available data to assess the performance of normal waterflooding.Any problems such as adverse viscosity ratios or large permeability variations should be identified. If the results of this study indicate that mobility control of the waterflood is warranted,the following laboratory tests are undertaken."}
{"text": "5.11.6.2.1 Viscosity Testing\n\nBased on the permeability of the reservoir,relative per- meability data,and the desired level of mobility control, polymers of certain molecular weights are selected for testing.Various concentrations of the polymers are dis- solved in both the available injection water and in blends of the injection and formation waters.Polymer solutions may be non-Newtonian at certain shear rates,that is,the viscosity decreases at high shear rates (shear-thinning or pseudoplastic).This shear-thinning behavior is reversible and,if observed in the reservoir,is beneficial in that good injectivity can result from the lower viscosity observed at high shear rates near the injection well.At the lower shear rates encountered some distance from the injector the polymer solution develops a higher viscosity.In this testing,it is important to consider not only the viscosity of the injected solution,but,more importantly,the in-situ viscosity that is achieved in the reservoir.Several things can happen that will reduce viscosity when the polymer solution is injected into the reservoir.Reduction in viscosity as a result of irreversible shear degradation is possible at the injection wellbore if the shear rates or shear stresses are large.Once in the reservoir,dilution with formation water or ion exchange with reservoir minerals can cause a reduction in viscosity,and the injected polymer concentration will need to be sufficiently high to compensate for all viscosity- reducing effects."}
{"text": "5.11.6.2.2 Polymer Retention\n\nRetention of polymer in a reservoir can result from adsorp- tion,entrapment,or,with improper application,physical plugging.Polymer retention tests are usually performed after a standard waterflood (at residual oil saturation)or during a polymer flood oil recovery test.If polymer reten- tion tests are conducted with only water initially present in the core,a higher level of retention will result from the increased surface area available to the polymer solution in the absence of oil.Effluent samples from the core are collected during both the polymer injection and a subsequent water flush.These samples are analyzed for polymer content.From a material balance,the amount of polymer retained in the core is calculated.Results are usually expressed in Ibs per acre-ft.Excessive retention will increase the amount of polymer that must be added to achieve the desired mobility control.The level of polymer retained in a reservoir depends on a number of variables: permeability of the rock,surface area,nature of the reser- voir rock(sandstone,carbonate,minerals,or clays),nature of the solvent for the polymer (salinity and hardness), molecular weight of the polymer,ionic charge on the polymer,and the volume of porosity that is not accessible to the flow of polymer solution.Polymer retention levels often range from less than 1001b/acre-ft to several hundred lb/acre-ft."}
{"text": "5.11.6.4 CO₂Flooding\n\nFor the gas injection projects,the trend in this country is toward the use of carbon dioxide although the full impact of CO₂flooding will be felt in several years since construction of CO₂pipelines into the west Texas area was completed in the 1980s.Carbon dioxide flooding is not a truly miscible process;that is,it does not dissolve in all proportions with crude oil.However,CO₂can extract light to intermediate components out of the crude oil.This CO₂-rich mixture can developmiscibility and effectively displace additional crude oil.The main limitation involved is the very low viscosity of CO₂that results in fingering of CO₂through the more viscous crude oil.This causes premature breakthrough of the CO₂and reduces the amount of oil recovered per unit volume of CO₂ ."}
{"text": "For steamflooding,the most important laboratory tests are,of course,viscosity of the crude oil and permeability of the reservoir core material.To be economically viable, steamfloods must be conducted in thick,very permeable, shallow reservoirs that contain very viscous crude."}

{"text": "Irrespective of the measurement or estimation method, deriving meaningful average apertures valid over many cubic feet or more is very difficult and best handled via alternate estimates covering a viable range."}
{"text": "Fracture apertures can be susceptible to changes due to changes in the reservoir stress system during production or injection operations.Typical fracture system compressibil- ities are 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than matrix pore system compressibilities.However,once the fracture system is related to a unit volume of rock,the total fracture plus matrix system compressibility is typically 2-3 times greater than the matrix only."}
{"text": "5.12.3.3 Fracture porosity\n\nThis is very difficult to measure directly as typical fracture porosities are usually less than 1%and are typically 0.1- 0.3%.Therefore they are often at or below typical open- hole porosity tool measurement thresholds(e.g.,density, neutron,sonic).For reservoirs with high-fracture intensi- ties and large apertures formed from say dissolution then porosities may be as high as 3-5%and the openhole poros- ity tools may be adequate.Note that some fault zones can have porosities in the range of 10-20%due to the intense fracturing and brecciation.However,these ntervals will usually form a small fraction of the total reservoir volume causing the reservoir average fracture fault-related porosity to be more like 1-2%or less."}

{"text": "Real well test responses in fractured reservoirs often display late time radial or linear flow (half slope)behavior.

{"text": "5.12.4 Fractured Reservoir Recovery Processes\n\nFor fractured reservoirs with most or all the storage in the fracture system,recovery is generally via depletion plus/minus fracture compressibility plus/minus aquifer or injection water ingress.Hydrocarbon saturations can be close to 100%with little or no transition zone due to the very high intrinsic permeabilities.Recovery is limited by the effectiveness of the depletion mechanism vs.water ingress and the connectivity of the fracture system to the well stock.Horizontal wells drilled across multiple fracture trends usually do best."}

{"text": "Although there is considerable uncertainty in most of the variables given by Bust[19],the uncertainty in permeability measurement is cause for concern—notin terms of theory as much as the practical deployment of the permeability esti- mation techniques for unconventional reservoirs.Specific to the issue of uncertainty in permeability measurements, Cui[19]provides insight on each of accepted permeability estimation techniques for unconventional(shale)reservoirs. Additional research is ongoing in the area of permeability estimation for shales,but in simple language,it is very unlikely that a simple model (such as Darcy flow experi- ments for convention-typereservoirs)will provide meaning- ful results for shale reservoir systems.As an example,it may be(and probably is)possible to correlate permeability with capillary pressure attributes for shale reservoir samples,but such correlations may literally be limited to samples for that given section of core."}
{"text": "One of the most frequent points of discussion in the flow of fluids for shale systems is the role of nanoscale flow behavior—in simple terms,whether the fluid behaves as a viscous fluid (like a normal liquid)or if the fluid behaves like a\"dilute\"gas(where in the most diffuse case the movement of the gas molecules would be governed by Brownian motion).The \"truth\"most likely lies somewhere in between."}

{"text": "5.13.5 Phase Behavior in Unconventional Reservoirs\n\nThe subject of phase behavior in unconventional (shale) reservoirs is perhaps the most active topic of research at present.In the initial development of liquids-rich shale reservoirs,the prevailing assumption was that traditional \"bulk fluid\"thermodynamics were sufficient for character- izing the \"confined\"fluids residing in nanopores.For about the last 5 years,there has been a broad and concerted effort to model fluids in confined domains.In chemical engi- neering,such modeling has been performed for a number of years (back well into the 1980s),but there was very little physical calibration data(especially for hydrocarbon fluids)and most of the modeling was performed on a single component,or perhaps a binary or ternary mixture.Present work focuses on \"bubblepoint\"suppression for volatile oil cases and \"dewpoint\"suppression for retrograde gas cases."}
{"text": "The goal of this discussion is to orient the reader that there are presently 2 schools of thought—first,that hydrocarbon fluids can be modeled as \"conventional\"bulk thermodynamic systems and second that molecular-level modeling must be performed to capture the appropriate thermodynamic behavior.This section discusses the results of recent studies as to how to best to consider the phase behavior for liquids-rich shale systems."}
{"text": "for the duration of the productive life of the well.There are exceptions,in particular some of the higher perme- ability shale plays do present depletion-like effects that very likely represent near-neighbor interference.However, with those exceptions noted,the behavior of wells in unconventional reservoirs having very long-term transient flow behavior is in direct contrast with conventional reser- voirs where transient flow last only a few days to a few weeks."}
{"text": "Perhaps equally important in this discussion is the fact that the well stimulation defines the reserves for wells in unconventional(shale)reservoirs.In short,well perfor- mance and recovery are directly proportional to stimulation size and effectiveness.More proppant and more dense fracture clusters have been shown conclusively to yield higher rates and recovery,but of course,there are off-setting economic factors that must be considered."}

{"text": "models continue to emerge.One possible advantage of these models is their use in discriminating the separate contributions of fracture half-length,fracture conductivity, the number of fractures,and the formation permeability. However;there will likely be uniqueness problems with these sorts of models,similar to issues experienced with the full multi-fracture horizontal well models."}
{"text": "measured rate and pressure data.The methodology for production analysis is called \"rate transient analysis\"(or RTA)and these tools are well-established as robust and accurate."}
{"text": "Itis worth mentioning that RTA methods are particularly well-suited for the analysis/interpretation of performance data from unconventional(shale)reservoirs.This is because the nature of these ultra-low permeability reservoirs ensures that a significant duration of data are required to produce a conclusive flow regime(i.e.,a clear and distinct signature of the reservoir).Unfortunately,for unconventional reservoirs, RTA methods require some foreknowledge of reservoir permeability in order to provide a unique analysis."}
{"text": "There is also a resurgence in interest of deploying pressure transient analysis (or PTA)methods;with the goal being to at least qualitatively validate the underly- ing reservoir signature.While PTA methods utilize high- frequency/high-resolution pressure data—for shales,PTA testing practices will require relatively long well shut-ins (on the order of 1.5-2 months of data acquisition)which may in some cases represent both a significant loss of revenue(due to production deferral)and a loss in reserves (due to adverse effects on the reservoir and/or completion from a prolonged shut-in)."}
{"text": "on the analysis/interpretation of production data—e.g.,the reservoir thickness is critical parameter for unconventional (shale)reservoirs,as well as the porosity and the phase behavior (oil and gas fluid properties).Well completion factors also rank high,particularly those factors directly related to the stimulation treatment.Lastly,and perhaps not so obvious,production practices can greatly affect the analysis and interpretation of production data—especially operational changes and unreported events.Time-rate(or decline curve)analyses are particularly susceptible to oper- ational changes as the time-rate methods do not incorporate pressure,which would tend to mitigate the influence of operational changes."}

Expansion through the two-phase region does not occur at constant pressure,but is accompanied by a decrease in pressure as the composition of liquid and vapor changes [5,6]."}

{"text": "In conclusion,it has been shown that the flash process occurs whenever we are dealing with a closed system or a steady-state flow,e.g.,a two-phase flow in vertical tubing, in horizontal pipe flow,and in separators.For any open system,such as a reservoir formation,or for an unsteady- state flow,the differential process is properly describing the quasiequilibrium conditions."}

{"text": "The FVF is B₀;because separators result in a flash separation,we showed a subscript,Bof.In most fluid stud- ies,these separator tests are measured only on the original oil at the bubble point.The FVF at the bubble point is Bofb.To make solution-gas-drive or other material-balance calculations,we need values of Bof at lower reservoir pressures.From a technical standpoint,the ideal method for obtaining these data is to place a large sample of reservoir oil in a cell,heat it to reservoir temperature,and pressure- deplete it with a differential process to stimulate reservoir depletion.At some pressure a few hundred psi below the bubble point,a portion of the oil is removed from the cell and pumped through a separator to obtain the flash FVF, Bof,at the lower reservoir pressure.This should be repeated at several progressively lower reservoir pressures until a complete curve of Bof versus reservoir pressure has been obtained.The process is time consuming and consequently adds to the cost of the study.Most studies include only values of Bob,the FVF at the bubble point.The values of Bof at lower pressures must be obtained by other means."}
{"text": "It is a fairly common practice to use differential vapor- ization data for material-balance calculations.Values of Bod and Rsd are almost always higher than the corresponding values from separator tests;consequently,calculations of OIPand recoverable oil will usually be lower than is correct.

This procedure is believed to be superior to the technique of basing the initial assumption of the phase composition on some noncomposition-dependent K value estimation procedure,particularly when a wide range of temperatures, pressures,component types,composition ranges,etc.,is to be considered."}
{"text": "The SRK(Equation 6.1.11)and the PR(Equation 6.1.13)require the smallest number of parameters of any of the equations of state.They require the critical temperature, the critical pressure,and the acentric factor.There are many different approaches that can be utilized to predict these parameters for C₆+fractions or other mixtures of undefined components."}

{"text": "6.2.16 Mechanistic models\n\nIn the past two decades,mechanistic models have been the focus of many investigations to improve the flow behavior predictions in multiphase flow.These models rely more on the theory or mechanisms (or phenomena)in multiphase flow rather than solely on experimental work.Empiricism is still used in a mechanistic approach to predict certain flow mechanisms or provide closure relationships.One of the preliminary works on mechanistic modeling of flow pattern transition and steady,upward,and gas-liquid flow in vertical tubes is presented by Taitel et al.[16].This flow pattern prediction was later modified by Barnea et al.[17]to account for a whole range of pipe inclinations. These two works have provided the basis for predicting flow patterns by defining transition boundaries between bubble, slug,churn,and annular flows.Although many mechanistic models predict flow behavior for a single flow pattern,only a few comprehensive mechanistic models such as Hasan and Kabir [18,19]and Ansari et al.[20]have been published in the literature to model all four flow pattern transitions in multiphase flow.Both these mechanistic the models have enjoyed considerable success in multiphase flow predictions and have generally been accepted in the petroleum industry. The Ansari et al.model [20]is relatively more complex, and the reader is referred to the original papers [20,21]for a complete presentation of the model.Only the details of the Hasan and Kabir model are presented here."}

{"text": "In installing a choke,the downstream pressure of the choke is usually 0.55 of the upstream pressure,or even less to ensure no change in flowrate or upstream pressure.This condition is called a sonic flow.A subsonic flow occurs when the upstream pressure or flowrate is affected by a change in downstream pressure."}

{"text": "Wells completed in highly permeable formations stabi- lize quicklyAs demand for gas increased over the years, wells were completed in less permeable formations.In wells of this type,the stabilization period may be very long. Therefore,methods were needed that would permit testing of this type of well without undue waste of time."}
{"text": "In 1955 M.H.Cullender described the isochronal method for determining flow characteristics [7].The method is based on the assumption that the slope of per- formance curves of gas wells,exponent n of Equation 6.3.9,is independent of the drainage area.It is established almost immediately after the well is opened.However,the performance coefficient C decreases with time as the radius of drainage recedes from the well.When the radius reaches the boundary of the reservoir or the area of interference of another well,C becomes a constant and the flow is stabilized."}
{"text": "Under the method the well is opened,the flow and pressure data are obtained at specific time intervals without changing the rate of flow.The well is then closed in until the shut-in pressure is reached,approximately the same as at the beginning of the first test.The well is then opened and produced at a different rate,and the pressure and flow data are collected.This procedure is repeated as many times as desired."}
{"text": "From these test and theoretical considerations,different procedures have been developed that permit prediction of the coefficients of performance of gas wells produced from low-permeability formations."}

{"text": "If only surface data are available,the productivity index of the well may be estimated by determining the flowing bottomhole pressures for two or more rates of production."}
{"text": "As stated,the size of the tubing is one of the impor- tant parameters affecting the pressure gradients.For low velocity,the slippage of gas by the liquid contributes to the pressure losses.For high velocities,friction becomes the controlling factor.Between these two extremes,there is a range of velocities giving the optimum gradient at the inlet of tubing in the bottom of the well."}
{"text": "If the future range of expected rates and gas/oil ratios can be estimated,selection of the tubing size can be made which would assure operation within the efficient range of the gradients,with the resulting increase in the flowing life of the well.Such selection can be made by calculating gra- dients for different tubing sizes for a given set of conditions."}
{"text": "To a degree,the wellhead pressure is controllable because it depends,among other things,on the size,length, and geometry of flow lines and on the separator pressure. At the same time,the wellhead pressure has a marked effect on the slope characteristics of the gradient because of the question of density which is involved.For a given reduction of the wellhead pressure,the reduction of the bottomhole flowing pressure may be substantially higher This is particularly true in case of high-density flow."}
{"text": "The reduction of the bottomhole flowing pressure should result in increase of production.It can be seen from the above that the degree of this increase cannot be estimated from the surface data alone.It can be estimated if infor- mation is available also on the flowing gradient and the productivity index of the well."}

{"text": "Actually,this last limitation is of small practical signifi- cance since chokes are usually selected to operate at critical flow conditions so that the well's rate of flow is not affected by changes in flowline pressure."}

{"text": "6.3.3.4 Flowline Performance\n\nUnderstanding the behavior of multiphase fluids flow in hor- izontal or inclined pipe is important because the efficiency of a producing system is accomplished by analyzing all components through which the fluids flow.In the analysis a flowline may be considered as a restriction because higher pressure loss resulted.For instance,for a given set of fluids data 2.5-in.line causes higher pressure loss when compared with 3 and 4-in.line,so one tends to take the larger size to produce more oil.The diameter,however,should not be oversized because additional slugging and heading may occur.Some operators just add a parallel line instead of replacing the current line with a larger size.It should be remembered that production capacity,pipes availability, separator pressure,and other constraints may be involved in judging a final design of producing system."}
{"text": "This technique does not require expensive,time- consuming tests.The pressure measurements can be very accurate,using a subsurface gage on flowing wells;they can be obtained with surface-recording downhole gage;or they can simply be obtained with casing pressure and fluid level shots,depending on the well condition."}

{"text": "PMF=prime mover factor\n\nThis prime mover factor-PMF consists of two com- ponents:a units conversion factor that accepts the other terms of equation 6.4.1 in the given units and converts the numerator product to horsepower;and a component that increases the horsepower to account for energy losses such as friction due to the cyclic nature of the prime mover load when applied to a pumping unit.The influence of these extra effects is not easily estimated.Thus an empirical adjustment is made based on experience.Another factor affecting motor size can be the trend towards longer stroke lengths on conventional beam type pumping units.The prime mover must be large enough to start the unit without the assistance of system inertia.Conventional beam pumping units with very long stroke lengths relative to their gearbox size,can exacerbate this initial loading to the point that although a given size motor is large enough to run the unit,it is not large enough to start it."}

{"text": "All sucker rod pumps require a device to hold them in place in the well.This device is the anchor or hold-down. There are two standard types of hold-downs,cup type and mechanical type.These hold-downs may be found on top or on bottom of the pump depending on the type of pump and the requirements.Some special pumps have a hold-down in the center of the pump,while others may have a hold-down at the top and at the bottom."}

{"text": "6.4.1.4.4 Rod Pumps\n\nA rod pump has the same basic parts as the tubing pump, but the barrel is not an integral part of the tubing as in the tubing pump;therefore,all the components of the pump can be pulled from the tubing using the rod string."}
{"text": "The rod pump is more versatile than the tubing pump.It has a much higher compression ratio when spaced properly, making it a better choice for gassy wells.The rod pump can be used at much greater depths than the tubing pump,but is not capable of pumping the large capacities.Rod pumps can be equipped with top or bottom hold-downs or both for a variety of applications."}

{"text": "When corrosive conditions exist,the metallurgy of the pump and downhole accessories should be chosen to resist the corrosion.Chemical inhibitors can be helpful but will not prevent corrosion in all cases.Such inhibitors protect casing,tubing,and rods better than the pump parts.Thus, corrosion resistance here is best obtained through proper selection of pump materials for construction.Refer to Chap- ter 7 for more details on corrosion mitigation."}
{"text": "The pumped-off condition can be prevented by slowing down the pump,using a smaller size pump or shorter stroke length,or putting the pump on a percentage timer if the prime mover is electric.Various pump-off controllers are available to sense when a well is nearing a pumped-off condition.The controllers then shut off the pump for a predetermined period."}
{"text": "If the fluid pound is caused by restricted fluid entry, none of the above alternative remedies are appropriate.Only proper pump servicing will remove the restriction."}
{"text": "6.4.1.5.4.3 Gas Pound\n\nGas pound has a behavior and observed effect somewhat similar to that of fluid pound but has a different cause."}
{"text": "It occurs when no \"pumped-off\"condition exists.There may or may not be an intake flow restriction.The cause of gas pound is occurrence of excessive gas in the pump barrel on the pump upstroke.It can be caused by inadequate downhole gas separation or gas breakout due to oil flow through flow restrictions in the standing valve or dip tube. A gassy crude can evolve significant gas if it is forced at high velocity through a flow restriction.If the gas pound is caused by excessive free gas and there is ample flow area in the standing valve port and cages,then a better gas anchor is needed.If flow restrictions exist,then more open cages and large-diameter dip tubes should be tried."}
{"text": "6.4.1.5.4.4 Sand Accumulation\n\nAlthough proper choice of metallurgy for downhole pump barrels,plungers,valves and cages will help in alleviating a sand accumulation problem,sand control methods should be evaluated also."}
{"text": "6.4.1.5.4.5 Scale Formation\n\nChemical scale deposits can occur in some producing wells, and in extreme cases be so severe as to seriously restrict flow of oil through the pump and tubing.Chemical scale inhibition agents are available that will either eliminate or significantly reduce the effect of scale deposition.Because scale deposition is a cumulative effect,treatment must follow a fixed and uninterrupted treatment regime.Refer to Chapter 7 for a complete discussion of the causes and control procedures for scale deposition."}
{"text": "6.4.1.6 Computation Procedure\n\nSelection of the proper equipment for a new well follows, an orderly sequence based on computation of pumping unit performance.The method suggested here is that recom- mended by API [9].Computer programs are available to perform the calculations described here for manual use.The API RP11L calculation procedure is intended for design of conventional geometry (class I)units pumping in non- deviated wells at depths of less than 12,000 ft.The method is based on use of API grade steel sucker rods."}
{"text": "Various commercially available computer programs, such as Rodstar and S-rod,make complete calculations for a wider variety of pumping unit types(class I,class I with Phased crank,and class Ⅲ units)rod types (steel rods, continuous rod,and fiberglass rods)depth and inclination of the hole.Some of these programs bases their design on dynamic analysis of the elastic behavior of the rods and tubing and can include inertial effects of the surface equipment.With correct input as to well conditions and equipment characteristics,these wave equation programs can make a very precise estimate of loads and stresses in he pumping system and lead to an optimal design."}
{"text": "Example 6.4.2\n\nGiven:A1 -in.plunger is being used to pump oil at 16 strokes per minute and an effective downhole stroke of 51.5 in.The pump volumetric efficiency is estimated to be 70%."}
{"text": "Desired:Daily surface production of oil,bpd."}
{"text": "partially flowing while pumping,the Ev can be above 100% (flumping wells).Several factors contribute to decrease Ev below 100%.These include slippage past the plunger on the upstroke and gas evolution from the oil as the oil enters the pump barrel and as gas evolves from the oil as it rises up the tubing.This latter effect is accounted for by the oil formation volume factor.An oil with a formation volume factor of 1.15 requires 1.15 barrels of oil at reservoir condition to yield 1.0 barrels at the surface.This factor, alone,without any pump slippage would give an Ev of (1/1.15)×100=87%."}
{"text": "The pump can displace the computed pump displace- ment PD only if the formation can produce this much oil. Optimal performance is obtained when the pump produc- tion at the surface matches the ability of the formation to produce,or when the pump produces at the statutory limit on production or the limit determined by prudent reservoir operation."}
{"text": "An example calculation is given below:\n\nGiven:A reservoir flow test indicated that the well flowed 100 bpd when the flowing bottomhole pressure was 1500 psia and the reservoir average pressure was 2000 psi."}
{"text": "Desired:Determine the flowrate in bp/d when the flow- ing bottomhole pressure is 250 psia."}
{"text": "Where the size of the selected pumping unit is critical or where little data are available,it may be desirable to use a test pumping unit to determine not only flow capacity but also working fluid levels."}
{"text": "6.4.1.6.3 Casing and Tubing Size and Tubing Anchor\n\nCasing size is usually determined long before the decision is made to install a beam pumping unit.Frequently,tubing is also already in place.However,its diameter and weight and weight per foot should be known.If tubing is already in place,it is not cost effective to change out the tubing for a large size as a means of installing a larger pump.Where a pump is needed that is larger than possible with the existing tubing,a casing pump should be investigated."}
{"text": "Tubing anchors have the advantage of keeping the tubing from buckling and oscillating during the pump cycle.Not only does this reduce wear on the tubing,but,as will be seen in the API RP11L calculations,anchors increase the net effective bottomhole stroke over that for unanchored tubing.Anchors can create problems in wells with severe scale,sand,or corrosion conditions as these conditions may so damage the anchor that it cannot be released to allow tubing removal."}
{"text": "6.4.1.6.4 Pump Setting Depth\n\nWhenever possible,the pump should be set at a depth in the well where pump intake pressure is above the bubble point of the oil as it is produced.This would suggest locating the pump one to three tubing joints below the perforations. Sometimes this is not possible because of total well depth, nor desirable because of sand production.Altermatively,the pump should be placed out of and above the turbulence zone near the perforations (three to six joints above the perforations).In any case,the pump should have significant submergence,50 to 100 ft of fluid,to assist in rapid fluid fillage of the pump barrel.For low productivity wells, this amount of submergence may not be either possible or economically feasible but the consequence will be that wells with lower submergence may experience pump-off and some type of pump-off controller would be needed."}
{"text": "6.4.1.6.5 Expected Pump Fluid Level\n\nThis is one of the needed parameters about which there will be much uncertainty in a new installation.If a well test and an inflow performance relationship is available for the well,one can possibly convert flowing bottomhole pressure to flowing liquid height.Such a calculation would be fairly accurate for nearly dead oils or for wells producing mostly water.An alternative,conservative design approach is to assume that the flowing liquid level is at the pump depth.Once a unit is in operation,one of the commercially available acoustical well sounders can be used to measure the working fluid level.This value would be useful in any comparison of the well's current performance with that predicted by the API RP11L procedure."}
{"text": "The above maximum stress method leads to the lightest rod string.It is not as conservative as the next or bal- anced stress method.In the balanced stress method,the percentages of each size rod in the 75 rod combination, for example,are adjusted until the same stress exists at the top of each size of rods.Usually this stress is less than the maximum allowable stress.The rod string selected by this method is somewhat heavier than the selected by the first method and is generally to be preferred."}

{"text": "first method is called continuous lift and is used in wells with production capacity such that it will flow continuously. The second method refers to intermittent lifting of wells where the reservoir is of very limited productivityQuite obviously,the intermittent lift method is inefficient and requires specialized surface equipment to handle the large rates involved whenever a slug of production reaches the surface.Because of the limited use of intermittent gas lift,this treatment will be confined to continuous gas lift. Continuous lift can be accomplished with casing-operated valves,tubing-operated valves,or valves that have charac- teristics of both.These will be described later."}
{"text": "The next section will describe concepts necessary for gas lift design and then will give example designs.First, some knowledge of the productivity of the reservoir is necessary to determine the required drawdown on the per- forations.If there is too little drawdown,the well underpro- duces.If there is too large,a drawdown and the perforations (gravel packs,etc.)could be damaged.Consequently,an engineering knowledge of the production capabilities of similar wells is required."}
{"text": "Another tool needed by the designer is a reliable or industry accepted computer software program for gener- ating a single gradient curve or a comprehensive set of gradient curves for multiphase flow of oil,water and gas in vertical pipes.These will be described in a later section."}
{"text": "6.4.2.1 Inflow Performance\n\nInflow performances of a reservoir can be defined as the functional relationship between the flowing bottomhole pressure and the resulting flowrate.Several models are available,such as straight line (productivity index,or PI, Vogel's method,the Fetkovich method,and others [13]."}
{"text": "Answer\n\nAssuming typical relative permeability relationships,we estimate the relative permeability of the reservoir to oil to be 0.25 and to water of 0.25.This yields a PI=3.25 bfpd/psi. Note that when this well produced all oil,the PI would be estimated at 1 bopd/psi."}

{"text": "Neither of these calculation techniques can be consid- ered preferable;each depends on the engineer's experience and the actual reservoir conditions."}
{"text": "6.4.2.2 Gradient Curves\n\nThe first concept needed in gas lift design is that of gradient curves.For the case of single fluid flow in pipes,one can calculate the total pressure difference between two points with well-defined mathematical equations,requiring only a friction factor empirical relationship for the case of turbulent flow.Even in the case of non-Newtonian flu- ids,appropriate assumptions have been made enabling the calculation of pressure difference with a single equation for pipe or annular flow.In the case of multiphase flow involving gas-liquid mixtures,a single equation is not possible.Pressure variation along the length of the pipe causes gas volume changes.In the case of oil-gas flow, the oil may liberate solution gas into the flow stream. Consequently,a change of the in situ gas-liquid fraction implies a constantly changing hydrostatic component of pressure,a constantly changing friction factor and,possibly an acceleration component of pressure change."}

{"text": "A typical valve must have a closing force(provided by a spring,gas pressured chamber,or both of these),an opening force(provided by a metal bellows upon which either tubing or casing pressure acts)and a flow-controlling orifice."}
{"text": "If tubing pressure is exerted against the bellows in the open position,this valve is referred to as a fluid-operated or production pressure—operated (PPO)gas lift valve.If casing pressure in applied on the bellows in the open posi- tion,then we have a casing-operated or injection pressure— operated(IPO)gas lift valve."}
{"text": "Gas lift valves operate similarly to pressure regulators."}
{"text": "On the other hand,a tubing-operated valve attempts to maintain a set tubing pressure.An increase in tubing pressure opens the valve to allow additional gas into the tubing in an attempt to lighten the fluid column above.If tubing pressure decreases,then the valve pinches down in an attempt to increase the tubing fluid gradient by reducing the gas flow into the tubing.There are several variations on this arrangement such as balanced valves,etc.,but these will not be covered here."}
{"text": "In the case of a tubing-operated valve,the situation is somewhat different in that a valve spread is meaningless. One would calculate a valve tubing closing pressure at a tubing pressure greater than the valve tubing opening pressure.This is impossible;thus the actual closing pressure for a tubing operated valve is determined experimentally in a test rack at the shop;however,the valve closing equation above for a casing operated valve is very close if we substitute tubing pressure for Pvc."}

{"text": "The value of Pcs to be used here may differ from that used to locate the first valve.For example,a design for casing- operated valves will require that the casing pressure be reduced.Therefore,the value to be used is the surface casing pressure available for that valve.In the example above for the first valve,assume the average minimum gradient to be 0.15 psi/ft.and the surface casing pressure available for the second valve is 975 psig.The deepest depth to which the second valve can be run is therefore 3421 ft."}

{"text": "This process is repeated when the third valve is uncov- ered,and the casing pressure is again lowered,consequently closing the second valve.This continues until all the unload- ing valves have been closed and the lifting valve is the only valve injecting gas into the tubing.Note that if the well supplies formation fluid at such a rate that the next lower valve cannot be uncovered,the well is flowing,which is the desired result.If conditions become favorable in the future, the next valve may be uncovered and the well will begin lifting from the lower valve."}
{"text": "The use of casing-operated valves implies that one has temporarily available gas at a higher than lift pressure for the unloading process,or the well will be lifted with less than available casing pressure,thereby lowering efficiency. However,due to the operating characteristics of casing valves,the pumper,by manipulating the surface valve,has some surface control of the lifting valve.This design could not be used in the case of a dual lift,that is,when there are two tubing strings in a single wellbore."}
{"text": "Fluid-operated valves are typically used whenever min- imal pumper surveillance is desired.Also,in the case of dual completions,the most popular choice is fluid-operated valves.However,another valve option would be \"balanced gas lift valves\".These type valves can be controlled with either casing annulus pressure or tubing pressure.There- fore,the gas lift designer can used either fluid-operated or balanced gas lift valves,which allow maximum utilization of the available casing pressure to the operating depth. The efficiency of the gas lift design increases by lowering the injection depth.However,a string of fluid-operated or balanced valves usually require more unloading valves than a string of casing-operated valves."}

{"text": "The lifting gradient has a pressure of 600 psig at the second valve at 3200 ft.A typical closing pressure of 650 psi is chosen for the second valve,and the liquid column transfer point from the third valve is chosen at 700 psi.This gives a depth of 4000 ft for the third valve.The gradient pressure at the third valve is 815 psig,giving a closing pressure of 860 psig and a transfer point of 900 psig.The fourth valve is therefore located at 4440 ft.with a gradient pressure of 860 psig.The valve closing pressure is taken as 950 psig and the transfer point as 985 psig."}
{"text": "This unloading process continues uncovering the next lowest valve and closing the valve above until a reservoir drawdown is achieved and formation fluid is lifted.In the example,formation fluid will be lifted by the third valve during the unloading process,but will be in small volumes since it will be on the order of perhaps 400 bfpd according to our PI information.If the PI used is correct and the lower valves are sized to input the correct gas flowrate,the well will continue to increase the drawdown until the last valve is lifting the well.If we can expect the well to produce 50 Mcfpd from the formation,then an injection rate of approximately 118 Mcfpd is required to bring the GLR up to 210 scf/bf.The valve chosen must be capable of varying gas flowates from the 118Mcfpd to 168 Mcfpd by throttling to accommodate those situations where the formation gas does not materialize,such as in the case of heading,etc.Its closing pressure will be less than 1000 psi,the value of the final lifting gradient at the valve depth."}
{"text": "Note that if our PI information were incorrect,a GLR gradient would indeed establish itself.For example,if the actual PI is higher,then the well will lift from a more shallow valve,perhaps the third or fourth.This would be a heavier gradient than the 210 GLR designed,but would establish itself at a greater liquid flowrate determined by the available gas and GLR actually established.If,on the other hand,the actual PI is less than expected,the well will unload to the deepest valve and establish a flow rate of less liquid with the available gas passage rate at a steeper lifting gradient.From experience,this variance,the predicated PI and the actual PI in the well completion,is one reason the gas lift design engineer would prefer the “bracketing envelope\"design method.The designer must be aware of both of these possibilities since a greater than expected liquid flowrate can be damaging to the formation (gravel pack,etc.)as can a greater than expected drawdown across the formation."}
{"text": "6.4.2.4.4 Casing Operated Valves Example\n\nThe same well described in the tubing-operated valves example will now be designed for gas lift with casing- operated valves.Several design techniques are available for casing-operated valves and one of these will be presented here.Further,an important assumption must be made con- cerning the casing pressure available.In this example,it is assumed that the 1000-psi lift gas is the maximum available pressure,that is,casing pressure cannot be increased,even temporarily.This assumption implies that the available casing pressure must be able to open all valves,even when there is no packer fluid in the casing annulus.Thisis the case whenever the well is shut-in(no packer fluid in the casing annulus)and the unloading valves are used to again start the well flow."}
{"text": "The depth to the first valve is found in the same way as the tubing operated valves at 2000 ft.Because of the condition mentioned above,the opening pressure of the first valve is chosen to be 1050 psig,or the casing pressure at depth.If the valves chosen have an Av/Ab of 0.067,the closing pressure of the valve at depth is 980 psig.This is an observed surface casing pressure of approximately 930 psig.Also,if the valve has a 200-psi spring effect,the required bellows pressure at depth is 793 psig,or a test rack pressure of 702 psig nitrogen pressure must be loaded into the bellows at 60°F.This surface casing pressure of 930 psig becomes the operating pressure of the second valve."}
{"text": "The depth to the second valve is chosen as the depth at which the U-tube pressures are equal:that of the casing (corresponding to a surface casing pressure of 930 psig)and the tubing.The tubing pressure is again a water gradient between the first and second valves and a GLR gradient from the first valve to the surface.A convenient gradient to use is the design lifting gradient from the deepest valve."}
{"text": "Since the depth is not known at this point,it must be decided.By knowing the valves below the first are to be closed by a decrease of 30 psi surface casing pressure,we determine that four valves are needed.This implies that the final surface casing lifting pressure is 870 psig and the design depth of injection is approximately 4400 ft.Using the Hagedorn-Brown correlation,the design GLR curve is found to be approximately 230 scf/bbl."}
{"text": "The closing pressure of the valve at 4400 ft.must be chosen such that the gas rate through the valve achieves the design GLR curve of 230 scf/bbl.If the formation can furnish 50 Mcfpd,then the valve must supply an additional 134 Mcfpd.This setting would depend on the type of valve and manufacturer used."}
{"text": "First,the circulated power fluid is ideal for carrying chemical additives.Corrosion,scale,and paraffin inhibitors can be added to extend the lift of the subsurface equipment. Also,if there are emulsions downhole in the produced fluids,emulsion breakers can be added to the power fluid stream."}
{"text": "Second,the commingled power fluid has a diluting effect.Where highly corrosive production fluids are being lifted,the clean power fluid reduces the concentration of the corrosive elements by about 50%.Where extremely viscous oil is produced,the injected power fluid has a diluting effect and can often reduce the viscosity enough to make lifting the heavy crude more practical."}
{"text": "Third,in production fluids with a high paraffin content, the OPF system allows the circulation of heated fluids or dissolving agents through the power fluid lines to remove waxy build ups which may hinder or halt production."}
{"text": "6.4.3.1.1 Types of Operating Systems\n\nThere are two basic operational types of hydraulic pump systems:the open power fluid system and the closed power fluid system.In an open power fluid (OPF)system the operating power fluid mixes with the produced fluid while down hole and both fluids are returned to the surface in a commingled state.In a close power fluid(CPF)system the production and operating power fluids are never allowed to intermix throughout the entire system.The closed power fluid system is used with piston pumps only."}
{"text": "This requirement for an additional tubing string,plus the associated complication of the bottomhole design,makes the closed power fluid system more expensive than the open system.For this reason,the CPF system is less popular and less used than the open power fluid configuration."}
{"text": "Since the produced fluids and power fluids are always separated,the closed system finds some advantage where the produced fluids are extremely abrasive or corrosive and where inhibitors are not used.A closed system allows the use of less exotic materials in the engine end of the pump and may extend the lift of both the pump and the surface power fluid facility."}
{"text": "of the power fluid tank is relatively small and almost all of the produced fluid can be put directly into the flow line."}
{"text": "In most down-hole pumps designed for use in a closed power fluid system,the,pump end is lubricated by the power fluid.However,approximately 10%of the power fluid is lost into the production fluid so this amount of make- up fluid must be fed back into the power fluid system from the production line."}
{"text": "It must also be realized that even in a closed system, the power fluid can not remain clean.First,all of the pipes,fitting,pumps,tanks,etc.are not completely free of contaminated materials.Second,when a liquid containing any solid material is leaked through a close fit clearance (such as slippage past the engine piston)the solid material will tend to be held back."}

{"text": "packer below the pump in order to vent gas to the surface. The production plus spent power fluid,returns by the casing annulus."}
{"text": "During production operations,the pressurized power fluid is pumped down the main tubing string where it operates the pump.It then mixes with the produced fluid and this mixture returns up the parallel string to the surface.This subsurface design permits gas to be vented up the casing annulus."}
{"text": "In parallel-free type installations,the main string should always be anchored to minimize tubing stretch as an unan- chored string could actually unseat the parallel string(s)and disable it (them)from functioning as a return conduit(s)."}
{"text": "6.4.3.2.4 Fixed-Pump Systems\n\nFixed-pump installations are like sucker rod tubing-pump installations,electric submersible pump installations,or conventional gas lift installations in that the bottomhole pump is attached to and run to bottom on the tubing string. These are considered to be \"permanent-type\"installations because a pulling unit is required to change out the pump."}
{"text": "inside diameter,larger pumps can be used which are able to produce larger volumes than those produced by a free style pump."}
{"text": "A variation of the fixed-insert design would involve a packer set below the pump and bottomhole assembly. This will cause all of the produced gas to go through the hydraulic pump but isolates the perforated zone below the pump from the rest of the well.This design would be advantageous when bad casing up the hole is a problem, or when another zone above the packer is being produced."}
{"text": "into the shoe assembly.The screw-in type requires more time to install and the use of parallel tubing string clamps."}
{"text": "6.4.3.2.7 Bottomhole Assemblies\n\nBottomhole assemblies(BHAs)are housings where hy- draulic pumps are located while they are operating.They have an internal seal sleeve that matches with a seal on the outside diameter of the pump when the pump is landed."}
{"text": "6.4.3.2.9 Cleaning the System\n\nIn a free-type installation,the system can be cleaned by, circulating fluid after installing the tubing standing valve and before installing the pump."}
{"text": "6.4.3.3.1 Power Oil\n\nPower oil has a natural lubricity that water does not.This is especially important when operating piston pumps due to their close tolerance clearances.Also,oil has some compressibility as opposed to water.This means that nei- ther the surface piston pump nor the subsurface pump is exposed to as much \"fluid hammer\"with oil as with water, and the service life of the equipment is usually longer on oil."}
{"text": "Significant drawbacks to power oil are the potentialfire hazard,which is not present with the use of power water, and pollution damage in the event of a line break."}
{"text": "A high-viscosity power fluid can mean excessive friction losses in the system.This in turn increases the operating pressure and,consequently the horsepower requirements for lifting the well.Therefore,in some instances it would be prohibitive to use the produced crude as a power fluid."}
{"text": "Water,because of its low viscosity,can be used in these instances.There are hydraulic installations where produced water is heated and used as a power fuid(and as a diluent\n\nor thinner)for the 8°gravity,crude being pumped."}
{"text": "Water,having low lubrication qualities,sometimes requires a chemical additive for lubrication when using hydraulic piston pumps.Frequently,the chemicals used will include oxygen inhibitors and agents to combat corrosion. These are easily added at the multiplex suction via a chemical pump.Improvements in lubricants,surface,and subsurface equipment,designed in recent years,has greatly enhanced the use of power water."}
{"text": "Aside from the usual chemical treatment for corrosion and scale depositions,salt crystals will occasionally be a problem in power water.This problem can usually be solved by having a fresh water blanket on the bottom of the power fluid tank,or by injecting fresh water into the power fluid."}
{"text": "Surface multiplex pump modifications for converting from oil service to water service are limited mainly to the fluid end of the pump and its plungers/lines.For example, a power oil fluid end can be made of ductile iron or forged steel but a fluid end for power water will be of aluminum/bronze to resist the corrosion effects of water.It is now common to use the aluminum/bronze fluid end for both power oil and power water.Metal-to-metal pistons and liners can be used for power oil service,but metal pistons against soft packing are needed for water service.As with the fluid end metallurgy,it is now common to use the soft packing for both water and oil service."}
{"text": "In any artificial lift method,including hydraulic and jet pumping,the pumping system must be designed to provide the extra energy necessary to lift the production to the sur- face at the desired(or achievable)rate.Thus,the producing bottomhole pressure for an established production rate is one of the primary pieces of input data required in the design of the installation."}
{"text": "6.4.3.4.2 Productivity Index\n\nPI is defined as the production rate in barrels per day(bbl/d), which can be achieved for each psi that the bottomhole pressure is reduced.It has long been used for estimating well production capacity."}
{"text": "H.H.Evinger and M.Muskat first introduced the con- cept of the PI relationship,shown in the following equation, in 1942 [19].However,as was suggested by Evinger and Muskat,the producing rate does not always change with producing bottom-hole pressure along a straight line as the PI equation suggests."}
{"text": "A given PI is valid only for the conditions for which its measurements were made,i.e.percentages of water and oil.As those values change,the accuracy of the PI value is reduced and a new value should be calculated or new measurement made."}

{"text": "Generally,the power fluid used to drive these pumps is clean crude oil or clean water drawn from the top of a settling tank or from a well site unit such as the Unidraulic@. In most installations,the spent power fluid is mixed with the produced well fluids at the pump and both come to the surface together."}
{"text": "The power required to return the spent power fluid to the surface is essentially what is required to overcome mechanical and fluid friction,and the difference in piston areas as seen by the power fluid and return fluid.The reason is that the static pressure head of the incoming power fluid at the pump tends to balance the static pressure head of the returning power fluid column."}
{"text": "As stated above,hydraulic subsurface piston pumps are composed of two basic sections—a hydraulic engine and a piston pump.They are directly connected with amiddle rod. Therefore,as the engine piston moves upward,the pump piston also moves upward causing the barrel chamber under the pump piston to fill with production fluid.When the hydraulic engine makes a down stroke,the pump piston also makes a down stroke displacing the production fluid in the pump barrel."}
{"text": "As stated above,the arrangement of the pump end is the same as with a sucker rod pump in that there is a barrel,a piston,a piston traveling valve,and a standing valve.As was also noted above,the sucker rod string is replaced with a column of high-pressure power fluid,which supplies the energy needed to move the engine piston.As the engine piston moves upward,the pump piston also moves upward,causing the barrel chamber under the pump piston to fill with production fluid.When the engine piston moves downward,the pump piston also makes a down stroke,displacing the production fluid in the pump barrel from below the pump piston to above it."}
{"text": "When the pump starts the upstroke,the reversing valve is positioned at the top of the valve body.Power fluid enters the pump through a port in the center of the valve body.The reversing valve directs the power fluid into the barrel above the reversing valve housing and under the upper piston. Because the pressure below the upper piston is greater than the pressure above it,the result is an upward movement of the piston."}
{"text": "The lower piston is also moving up,causing the spent power fluid above that piston to enter the lower end of the valve body.This spent power fluid passes by the reversing valve as it leaves the pump and returns to the surface."}
{"text": "Below the lower piston,the pressure is reduced inside the lower barrel and between the lower valves by the upward movement.This reduced pressure opens the inlet valve,and the higher pressure on the return side closes the discharge valve.This allows production to enter the lower barrel so it can subsequently be discharged on the downstroke."}
{"text": "upstroke,a reduced O.D.section of the middle rod enters the I.D.of the reversing valve.This undercut creates a path that allows the top of the reversing valve to be exposed to the power fluid.With a higher pressure above,the reversing valve is made to shift to the bottom of the reversing valve body.This shift causes the power fluid to be directed to the lower half of the pump and the downstroke begins."}
{"text": "On the downstroke,production in the lower barrel is dis- charged.Production also enters the pump below the lower production inlet valve and is directed to the upper valve section through side tubes in the bottomhole assembly.This fluid then enters the upper barrel,above the piston,to be subsequently discharged on the next upstroke."}
{"text": "The upper piston is also moving down,causing the spent power fluid below it to enter the upper end of the valve body."}
{"text": "Another upstroke begins as the pump reaches the end of the downstroke.Again,areduced O.D.section of the middle rod enters the I.D.of the reversing valve.This undercut creates a path that allows the bottom of the reversing valve to be exposed to the power fluid.With a higher pressure below,the reversing valve is made to shift to the top of the reversing valve body.This shift causes the power fluid to be directed to the upper half of the pump and the upstroke begins."}
{"text": "Because the power fluid is cleaned and chemically treated at the surface,it provides good chemical protection to virtually all of the pump."}
{"text": "6.4.4.4 Piston Velocity\n\nA common cause of failure among all piston pumps is excessive piston velocity on the displacement stroke.This usually occurs when a pumped-off or fluid pound situation occurs."}
{"text": "6.4.4.5 Fluid Separation\n\nObviously,there must be some means of keeping high- pressure power fluid and low-pressure return fluid separated both inside and outside of the pump."}
{"text": "Internally,a close-fitting metal-to-metal seal around the middle rod accomplishes separation.This seal prevents the power fluid inside the pump from bypassing the pump engine and mixing with the produced fluids.A leak or loss of this seal results in reduced pump speed and engine efficiency."}
{"text": "Externally,separation is accomplished by elastomeric seals on the outside diameter of the pump and one or more seal collars,which are part of the bottomhole assembly. This seal prevents the power fluid outside of the pump from bypassing the pump engine and mixing with the produced fluids.A leak or loss of this seal also results in reduced pump speed and engine efficiency."}
{"text": "Ensure that pump selection calculations are done carefully If the P/E is too low,the increase in power fluid volume will cause increased friction loss in the system,resulting in higher multiplex pump pressure."}
{"text": "There are two types of power fluid conditioning systems for hydraulic pump installations:the central power fluid conditioning system and the well-site,self-contained power fluid conditioning system(UnidraulicO)."}
{"text": "The power fluid-settling tank in this system is usually a 24-ft.-high,three-ring,bolted steel tank.A tank of this height generally will provide an adequate head for gravity flow of fluid from the tank to the intake of the charge pump. The diameter of the power fluid tank is dictated by the amount of power fluid required."}
{"text": "The basic purpose of the power fluid settling tank is to allow separation of solids from the power fluid,which the lease separator has not removed in the continuous flow system.The clean fluid is supplied to the surface pump, where it is pressurized and then used to operate the down- hole pump."}
{"text": "In a tank of static fluid,all foreign material in the fluid,\n\nwhich is heavier than the fluid would fall or settle out to the bottom.Some of the particles,such as fine sand would fall more slowly than the heavier solids.These factors, plus viscosity-related resistance factors influence the rate of separation.In time,however,all solids and heavier liquids would settle out leaving a layer of clean fluid."}
{"text": "In an actual power fluid system it is not practical, nor is it necessary,to furnish tank space to allow settling under perfectly still conditions.Sufficient settling can be accomplished when the upward flow through the settling tank is maintained at a velocity just slower than the velocity at which the contaminating material will fall.It has been found through tests and experience that an upward velocity of 1 ft./hr is low enough to provide gravity separation of entrained particles in most crude oils."}

{"text": "After the fluids leave the desander(s),they enter the ves- sel,where they pass over a series of baffles.There free gas is separated from the fluid flow and sent to the production line. The remaining fluid,which consists of oil and water,then passes over additional baffles that cause the two liquids to separate from each other.Another baffle is located such that any sediment in the vessel is prevented from entering the power fluid outlets and going to the triplex.By appropriaely adjusting the outlets,either oil or water can be sent to the triplex for use as the power fluid,and the vessel made to fill with the desired power fluid (either oil or water).An auxiliary pump is available tocharge the intake of the triplex pump if it is needed,but the pressure in the vessel,which is usually flowline pressure,is almost always sufficient to meet that requirement.If the flowline pressure is too low, then a back-pressure valve can be installed between the horizontal vessel and the flowline in order to increase the pressure in the horizontal vessel.This vessel also has a safety relief valve that is preset to open at the maximum working pressure."}
{"text": "The purpose of the tanks is to supply the multiplex pump with sufficient fluid.If the liquid level in the horizontal vessel is allowed to drop to a point that the pump draws gas,the pump will cavitate and cause damage.Therefore, as protection for the pump,an oversupply of fluid must be directed to the vessel.The fluid not required by the multiplex pump is automatically discharged to the flow line."}
{"text": "This over supply of fluid is also important in maintaining a proper oil/water interface.If the supply is insufficient,the interface level will move up to the pump suction connection on the vessel.The interface often carries iron sulphite, which can cause pump damage."}

{"text": "A cyclone desander,microstrainer,filter,centrifuge,or similar device is used to remove solids such as sand,silt, dirt,or drilling mud,from the produced fluid or from any fluid that is subsequently used to operate a hydraulic pump.The desander should function to provide a fluid clean enough to prevent excessive wear in the surface multiplex pump and the subsurface(downhole)hydraulic pump."}
{"text": "Surface pumps,subsurface piston pumps,and hydraulic engines used to drive the piston pumps are the components of an hydraulic pumping system most susceptible to wear because they contain close fitting metallic parts moving next to or rubbing against each other.Jet pumps are also subject to wear when operated with contaminated fluids."}
{"text": "Most subsurface piston pumps and hydraulic engines have a piston/cylinder radial clearance of 0.001 in.Other parts of the pumps have metal-to-metal seals which have clearances of less than 0.001 in.Solid contaminants in the fluid cause wear leading to excessive clearance of mating parts.This,in turn,leads to inefficient operation of the components and eventual replacement."}
{"text": "6.4.4.8.6 Removal of Suspended Solids\n\nThe volume of suspended solids such as sand,drilling mud, and scale in one barrel of produced fluid may be 100 lb or more when a pump is first installed in a well.More typical is a well with particles in the 10-to 500-micron size range and a total content of suspended solids of 100 Ib or less per 1000 barrels entering the cyclone desander inlet."}
{"text": "With reasonable operating efficiency,the cyclone desander should allow no more than 5%of the total sus- pended solids to pass on to the clean fluid reservoir.Of these solids,none should be larger than 25 microns(.001 diameter).No more than 20%of the total suspended solids entering the desander should be larger than 10 microns (.0004 diameter)and the remaining 80%should be 10 microns or less."}

{"text": "6.4.5.2.2 Seal Section\n\nThe seal section's primary purpose is to isolate the motor oil from the well fluid while bottomhole pressure(BHP) and the motor's internal pressure are balanced.There are two types of seal section design—the positive seal and the labyrinth path.The positive seal design relies on an elastic, fluid-barrier bag to allow for the thermal expansion of motor fluid in operation,while still isolating the well fluid from the motor oil.The labyrinth path design uses the specific gravity of the well fluid and motor oil to prevent the well fluid from entering the motor.This is accomplished by allowing the well fluid and motor oil to communicate through tube paths connecting segregated chambers."}
{"text": "The amount of free gas by volume at pump intake conditions should be no more than 10%to 15%by volume. The standard intake has several fairly large ports,allowing fluids to flow into the lower section of the pump and enter the bottom stage in the pump.Some models are equipped with a screen to keep large debris out of the pump."}
{"text": "The rotary gas separator will separate free gas with an efficiency of up to 90%under some conditions.The rotary gas separator should be used where the free gas available at the intake exceeds 20%(VLR of 0.20),unless there is abrasive material in the fluid.Then the use of rotary separator must be carefully considered.Even though the rotary gas separator is very efficient,there can still be cases where the pump will gas lock.If the pump intake pressure gets so low that slug flow develops,then there will be moments of time when nothing but gas is present at the intake.Only during this interval will gas enter the pump."}
{"text": "6.4.5.2.4 Multistage Centrifugal Pump\n\nThe ESP pump is a multistage centrifugal pump type.A stage consists of an impeller and a diffuser.The impeller is keyed to the shaft and rotates at the rpm of the motor. Centrifugal force causes the fluid to move from the center (or eye)of the impeller outward.These forces impart kinetic or velocity energy to the fluid."}
{"text": "The diffuser is stationary,and its function is to direct the fluids to flow efficiently from one impeller to another and to convert a portion of the velocity (kinetic)energy into pressure(potential)energy."}
{"text": "The stages (an impeller-diffuser combination)are placed onto a keyed shaft and then loaded into a steel housing(pipe or tube).When the threaded head and base are screwed into the housing,they compress against the outside edge of the diffuser.It is this compression that holds the diffusers stationary.If for any reason this compression is lost,then the diffusers would be free to rotate.This rotation would cause the pump to lose almost all of its ability to produce any head(or lift)."}
{"text": "The impellers incorporate a fully enclosed curved vane design,the maximum efficiency of which is a function of impeller design and type,which generally increases when the volumetric capacity of that design.The operating efficiency is a function of the percent of design capacity at which the impeller is operated."}
{"text": "The fluid enters the impeller at the eye.The vanes in the impeller create channels through which the fluid is directed. The size of the impeller(or the volume between the upper and lower shroud)determines the volume per unit time(or fluid rate)that can be produced."}
{"text": "There are two types of impellers used in oil well sub- mersible pumps.These are the radial flow and the mixed flow.The radial stages generally range from 200 to 2500 BFPD.The radial stage is a flat stage and is the most efficient design for these lower flow rates.The mixed-flow stage ranges from approximately 1700 up to 40,000 BFPD."}
{"text": "The VSD also protects the downhole motor from poor- quality electricity power.The VSD is relatively insensitive to incoming power balance and regulation while providing closely regulated and balanced output.The VSD will not put transients out to the downhole motor but it can be shut down or damaged by such transients.Given the choice,most oper- ators prefer to repair surface installation equipment rather than pull and run downhole equipment.Within limits,the VSD upgrades poor quality electric power by \"rebuilding.\" The VSD takes a given frequency and voltage AC input, converts the AC to DC,and then rebuilds the DC to an AC waveform."}
{"text": "The soft-start capability of a VSD provides two major benefits.First,it reduces the startup drain on the power sys- tem.Second,the strain on the pump shaft(and its associated components)is significantly reduced when compared with that of a standard start.This capability is valuable in gassy or sandy wells.In some cases,slowly ramping a pump up to operating speed may avoid pump damage."}
{"text": "Pressure-Sensing Instrument\n\nThe pressure-sensing instrument provides the operator with precise downhole pressure and temperature data. This instrument has two components:the downhole trans- ducer/sending unit,and a surface readout unit.The down- hole transducer/sending unit connects electrically and bolts to the base of the motor.Both pressure and temperature are transmitted from the transducers/sending unit to the surface readout through the motor windings and the power cable on a DC carrier signal.The transducer receives operating power from the motor's neutral winding.This allows the operation of the pressure-sensing instrument even when the motor is not running."}

{"text": "In PC pumping systems,there are basically three types of elastomers.The formula for an elastomer is generally proprietary,and as a result,there is no naming standard. However,there are certain generic names common to the manufacturers,but the properties of the elastomers can vary significantly.For example,there are approximately 20 different ingredients such as fillers,plasticizers,curatives, and carbon black.Of each of these ingredients,there are a number of different types,which can lead to an infinite num- ber of formulations.Almost all of the PC pump elastomers use some variation of a synthetic nitrile rubber."}
{"text": "Nitrile(NBR)—Trade Name Buna The majority of elastomers are classified as a conventional nitrile rubber (NBR).The base polymer is an emulsion copolymerisation of butadiene with acrylonitrile.NBR elastomers are typi- cally classed as a medium nitrile(Buna)or high nitrile."}
{"text": "Medium Nitrile(Buna):The medium nitrile has ACN content between 30%and 40%.It is sulphur or peroxide cured at elevated temperatures.For these reasons it is not recommended for applications that contain high levels of H₂S or temperatures that exceed 100℃(212°F),due to the advanced vulcanization and surface hardening that occurs."}
{"text": "Medium nitrile elastomers typically have the best mechanical properties,are the easiest to mold,and generally are the most economical."}
{"text": "High Nitrile:High-nitrile elastomers have ACN con- tent between 40%and 50%.Increasing the ACN content increases the polarity,which improves the elastomers resis- tance to nonpolar oils and solvents such as benzene,toluene, and xylene.However,increasing the ACN content generally results in a decline in certain mechanical properties."}
{"text": "Fluroelastomers (FKM)—Trade Name VITON Flu- orine is used to saturate the carbon bond.The carbon fluorine bond is extremely strong,which gives it superior heat and chemical resistance to NBR elastomers.FKM elastomers contain low level of fillers and additives but a high mount of fluro-polymer.The low level of fillers and additives results in extremely poor mechanical properties."}
{"text": "Oilfield fluids that commonly cause swell are:\n\n● Higher API gravity oils that contain single-ring aromat- ics (i.e.,benzene,toluene,xylene)."}
{"text": "Swelling can cause an excessively tight rotor/stator interference fit.A certain amount of torque is required to overcome the rotor/stator interference fit.In some cases, because of swelling,it is not uncommon to have the fit become so tight that the torque required to overcome the fit exceeds what is available with the surface drive configura- tion.A tight pump can cause accelerated hysteresis that may eventually result in a premature pump failure.Badly swollen stators can generally not be reused.However,if swelling is minor the stator can sometime be sized with a smaller rotor and reused.The internal operating temperature of the pump due to the friction heat generated by the rotor/stator interference fit can be significantly higher than the reservoir fluid temperature."}
{"text": "Softening\n\nCertain fluids that attack the chemical make-up of the elastomer will breakdown some of the mechanical prop- erties,which results in softening of the elastomer.Amine- based corrosion inhibitors are a good example of a chemical that will cause severe softening of an elastomer."}

{"text": "Thermal Swell\n\nHeat causes overall expansion.Operating at elevated tem- peratures will result in advanced vulcanization and the deterioration of the elastomer's mechanical properties such as tear strength."}
{"text": "Gas Swell\n\nThe amount of gas that can enter the elastomer is dependent on the permeation rate,diffusion process,and solubility of the gas in the elastomer.The diffusion process is governed by temperature,pressure differential,and elastomer thick- ness.The higher the diffusivity rate,the easier it is for gas to move in and out of the elastomer.The permeation rate is determined mainly by the gas size,shape,and polarity. Solubility determines the quantity of gas that will absorb into the elastomer.Gas solubility increases as the molecular weight of the gas increases;i.e.,CO₂and H₂S have higher molecular weight than methane and therefore are more soluble."}
{"text": "Explosive Decompression\n\nWhen an elastomeric compound is exposed to high pressure for a period sufficient for gas molecules to diffuse into the compound,a subsequent rapid reduction in pressure can cause internal fracturing of the rubber.Internal fracturing may be in the form of cracks or blisters.This phenomenon is known as explosive decompression(ED)."}
{"text": "ED is the result of a three-stage process:\n\n● Stage One,gas diffusion into the elastomer."}
{"text": "● Stage Three,is crack growth and subsequent blister formation in the areas of LES."}
{"text": "For blister growth the critical pressure inside the gas bubble must be at or above the fracture or tearing strength of the elastomer.The critical pressure required for crack growth or blistering increases with the square root of the elastic modulus and critical tear strength of the material."}
{"text": "As the distance below the surface of the elastomer increases,the critical pressure required to initiate crack or blister growth increases.This would mean that you would expect to see less damage toward the center of the material than at the surface;however,the opposite is the normal. Observations of failed pieces often show that ED damage is generally greater in the thicker sections.This is explained by the ability of the gas molecules to easily diffuse out of thin sections of elastomer or the surface layer as opposed to migrating out from thicker sections."}
{"text": "Gas Pressure\n\nGas pressure correlates directly to the pressure within the areas of LES.Therefore the higher the operating pressures of the PC pump the greater the gas pressure within the areas of LES.Higher gas pressure will create more energy for crack and blister growth."}

{"text": "6.4.6.5.3 Recoil Control\n\nRod string backspin occurs whenever a surface driven PC pumping system shuts down due to either routine operator intervention or automatic power cut-off in overload cases in which the pump seizes or sands up.When the power supply to the drive is lost or interrupted,the torsional strain and fluid energy that is stored in the production system during pumping is released.The release of this energy will cause the surface equipment and drive string to accelerate in the direction opposite to its normal operating mode.If not suitably restrained by the surface drive braking equipment,backspin speeds can increase to the point where severe equipment damage results.The most serious type of incident(due to its potential to cause personnel injury)is the fragmentation and subsequent \"explosion'radially outward of drive head sheaves."}
{"text": "Backspin events can be divided into two different types:\n\n(1)routine shutdown of the pumping system (i.e.,normal shutdown),and (2)when the pump rotor seizes within the stator (i.e.,seized pump scenario).In a normal shutdown, the fluids in the production tubing drains back to the well through the pump causing both the pump and drive system to rotate backward.This continues until the fluid column in the annulus and the pump friction balance the fluid energy in the tubing.This can take anywhere from several minutes to hours depending on the circumstances. Although the recoil event resulting from a normal shut- down can result in equipment damage due to excessive energy input,there is usually limited potential for a catas- trophic failure as long as the brake is initially functional. More likely to produce a catastrophic failure is the seized pump scenario.In the instance,shutdown occurs with the drive string is usually loaded to an extremely high torque. Strain energy(twists)stored in the drive string tends to be released rapidly resulting in a short but high-speed recoil."}
{"text": "There are five major types of recoil devices used in progressing cavity pumping systems."}
{"text": "Vane\n\nDrive head braking resistance is developed using a vane style hydraulic pump that is activated in the recoil or shutdown mode through a normally overrunning clutch. Clutch engagement occurs during backspin as a result of rollers in the outer portion of the clutch locking onto an inner clutch hub that is located on the drive head shaft. Engagement of the clutch causes the vane pump rotor within the drive head to rotate with in its housing.Rotation of the rotor produces braking torque by forcing the drive head lubricant oil through a restriction.Baking torque generated in the vane style pump is transferred from the rotor through the clutch and into the drive shaft and polished rod."}
{"text": "Hydrodynamic\n\nMuch like the torque converter in a vehicle,braking is accomplished by forcing vanes to rotate within a viscous fluid."}
{"text": "Safe Operation of Wellhead Drives\n\nWhen undergoing a controlled or uncontrolled shut down of a progressing cavity pumping system,it is critical to understand the recoil speed,if left unrestricted,can exceed the surface drive component (brake/belts/sheaves)ratings and cause that component to fail.The worst type of failure from a personal safety standpoint is to exceed the rim speed of he sheaves casing the sheave to explode."}
{"text": "● Maximum torque should not exceed the torque rating of the sucker rod string."}
{"text": "History shows that throughout the industry most of the serious incidents with any PC pump drive heads have occurred when the pump is seized downhole and PC pump- ing system has been torqued up in an attempt to free the pump.In a direct electric application,this input torque is typically limited only by the maximum horsepower the motor can deliver and the rod strings ability to transmit torque down to the pump.Unknown to most operators is the fact that all electric motors have the ability to deliver over 250%of the full load nameplate horsepower.This potential applied torque can far exceed the published structural and braking limits of the drive head."}
{"text": "In new installations,the best way to limit the maximum torque input is to restrict the motor size and sheave ratio in order to limit the maximum torque that can potentially be applied.Under certain circumstances,the potential exists for a recoil event to occur where the stored energy in the rod string and the fluid column may be greater than the drive head is designed to control."}
{"text": "This potential is based on the sheave ratio and the connected horsepower in direct electric motor applications and ability of the drive head recoil control device to safely handle the recoil."}
{"text": "Remember that the recoil control unit of any surface drive should be considered as a safety device to control the release of torque from the rod string during shut down, bit it not the only means of safe operation.For improved overall safety in operation and shut down of progressing cavity surface drive systems,the follow steps should be considered."}

{"text": "line frequency.With the addition of a variable frequency drive(VFD),motor speeds can be increased 50%,and then the maximum polished rod speed becomes 300 rpm in this example.Note that motor torque decreases as motor frequency increases above rated speed."}
{"text": "6.4.6.6.2 Sheave Selection\n\n● Sheaves are made with either cast iron or ductile iron. Cast iron has a maximum sheave rim velocity of 65,000 ft./min.Depending on he situation;recoil speeds in excess of this can be reached.A spoked wheel ductile iron sheave is rated for a maximum speed of 10,000 ft./min and a solid wheel ductile sheave for 15,000 ft./min."}
{"text": "● Using a Power Transmission Products Manual the horsepower each belt transfers can be determined;and knowing the Horsepower requirements,calculating the number of belts is simple.Ensure that the combined horsepower rating of all the V belts exceeds the design horsepower of the system."}
{"text": "● If the amount of power transferred by V belts is a concern than a high torque drive(HTD)belt and corre- sponding sprockets are recommended.This combination provides a positive slip-proof engagement when the belt teeth mesh with the sprocket grooves."}
{"text": "6.4.6.7.1 Preinstallation Procedures\n\n1. Clean out the well,removing any solid (e.g.,sand, coal fines)build-up in the bottom of the wellbore.It is recommended that a minimum of 2 or 3m below the pump be clear.Solids build-up should also be at least 2m below the bottom of the perforations."}
{"text": "2.Ensure all proper crossovers and changeovers are on location to attach the stator to the tubing string and the rotor to the rod string.It is recommended that swages be avoided due to their restricted drift and potential for thread failure."}
{"text": "5.The rotor and stator are matched for optimum pump effi- ciency in a particular application.Ensure the rotor serial number located on the rotor head(top)corresponds with the last set of numbers on the stator."}
{"text": "2. Attach stator to first tubing joint with appropriate fit- tings.Depending on the pump model being used,it may be convenient to attach a pup joint directly on top of the stator to reduce the assembly length and simplify handling.If the production tubing is of smaller diameter then the pump stator,run larger diameter tubing above the pump and then use a crossover to down size.It is recommended that any down size in tubing be done at least 1.2m (4 ft.)above the stator.Failure to do this may restrict the eccentric rotor movement and produce fatigue failures in the rod string directly above the pump."}
{"text": "6.4.6.7.3 Rotor Installation Procedures\n\n1.Count out the number of rods required to equal the total tubing tally plus one extra rod to ensure sufficient length of rod string.Be sure to include the length of the rotor Check all rods for evidence of damage,wear,and corro- sion.It is recommended that rods that are permanently deformed (i.e.,yielded)due to excessive torque not be used in applications with high loads or fluctuating loads. Use APIRP11BR Section 6(\"Recommended Practice for Care and Handling of Sucker Rods\")as a guide to grade the rod.Replace all suspect or substandard rods."}
{"text": "2.Care should be taken while handling the rotor on surface to avoid damaging the pin threads or the finished surface. The rotor should be supported in a manner as to prevent excessive bending that may cause permanent damage."}
{"text": "3.Liberally apply grease over the full length of the rotor to provide initial lubrication.Attach the rotor to the first sucker rod.A transition coupling may be required if the rotor pin and sucker rod threads are not the same size.It is recommended that one standard rod without guides (i.e.,7.6 m (25 ft.)be placed above the pump rotor before any pony rods are added to the string.This is because the positioning of large centralizers or guides a short distance above the pump may restrict the orbital\n\nmotion of the rotor causing damage to the pump.If pony rods are required directly above the rotor they should be limited to a 0.3m(1ft.)machined pony rod."}
{"text": "6.4.6.8 Space Out Guidelines\n\n1.Record the weight of the rod string before to running the last few sucker rods."}
{"text": "2.Continue to run the remaining sucker rods taking care to lower them very slowly to avoid damaging the stator elastomer.The rod string will normally rotate as the rotor enters the stator."}
{"text": "3.Continue to lower the rod string until the rotor comes to rest on the tag bar at the bottom of the stator.This bottoming out will be indicated by a reduction in rod weight to near zero.Pull up and lower the rotor again to reconfirm that it is positioned on the tag bar."}
{"text": "4.With the rotor landed on the tag bar,pull up slowly on the rod string until full rod weight (measured in step 1 above)is restored.At this point all slack is taken out of the rod string and the rotor is slightly above the tag bar."}
{"text": "5.Lift the rod string the distance from the tag bar to the bottom of the stator rubber.This tag bar distance was measured in step 6 under \"Stator Installation Procedures.\"\n\nThe space-out procedures also need to compensate for rod stretch due to pump loading.This distance can be obtained from the manufacturer."}
{"text": "To accommodate for rod stretch during operation the rods should be lifted up by the amount determined above.Note that in some cases it may be necessary to space-out an incremental amount to account for thermal expansion of the rod string."}
{"text": "6.The rotor is now correctly landed in the stator and the length of the sucker rods in the hole must be adjusted to allow for the polish rod.The rotor should now be in the operating position.Do not lift the rotor from this position.Landing with least amount of rotor sticking out of the stator minimizes downhole vibration."}
{"text": "7.Measure the height of the drive head and add the length of the drive assembly to the operating position.This becomes the clamping point.Allow and additional 6 in.to 12 in.for polish rod stick up above the clamping point."}
{"text": "8.Remove enough of the sucker rods to make room for the polish rod.The difference between the sucker rod removed versus the length of polish rod added must be made up with pony rods.It is recommended that the polish rod be long enough to allow the rotor to be pulled totally out of the stator without removing the surface equipment.Not only is this important to allow a proper flush-by procedure,but itis also a safety consideration in well servicing operations."}
{"text": "9.Attach the polish rod to the top pony rod using a polish rod coupling.To ensure proper sealing of the stuffing box,it is critical that the polish rod is straight and does not have significant wear or corrosion.It is recommended that the polish rod not be used to move or lift the drive head because of the potential to cause permanent bending of the polish rod.DO NOT leave wrench marks on the polish rod."}
{"text": "10.Confirm the pump space-out(steps 3 to 7above)with the modified string configuration.The target mark should be within 15cm (6 in.)of the top of the polish rod.If it is not,make the necessary adjustments to the pony rod lengths.When properly positioned,install a clamp on the polish rod adjacent to the top of the flow tee.It is also recommended that any pony rods be buried at least two full sucker rod lengths down the rod string to prevent surface vibration problems."}

{"text": "s=skin effect\n\nEach of the variables on the right-hand side of Equation 6.5.1 affects well productivity,and certain actions may favorably change its impact.Of particular interest to the stimulation engineer are the permeability and the skin effect.Both of these variables may be obtained from a pretreatment pressure transient test.Ignorance of these two variables would result in an inappropriate or less than optimum stimulation treatment;in addition,a posttreatment analysis and job evaluation would be impossible."}
{"text": "As can be easily seen from Equation 6.5.1,a low value of the permeability(tight reservoir)or a high value of the skin effect(damaged or badly completed well)would result in low well productivity.There is virtually nothing practical that can be done to the permeability,although cer- tain investigators have erroneously suggested that hydraulic fracturing increases the effective reservoir permeability.A hydraulic fracture is a superimposed structure on a reservoir that remains largely undisturbed outside of the fracture.The fracture,however,can greatly improve the well productivity by creating a large contact surface between the well and the reservoir.The production improvement results from effectively increasing the wellbore radius."}
{"text": "Prats [72]proposed the idea of an “equivalent wellbore radius.\"That is,there would be some artificial(equaivalent) wellbore radius,rw,that would produce the same production as the fractured well."}
{"text": "Asafirst approximation torw,one can simply equate the inflow surface areas."}
{"text": "Matrix stimulation is generally intended to reduce a large skin effect resulting from permeability damage around the wellbore during completion or production.Often,there is confusion in distinguishing matrix acidizing(a form of matrix stimulation)from acid fracturing.The latter requires that the treatment is done at formation fracturing pressure, and it relies on a residual etched width of the created fracture.The two methods of stimulation are applicable to entirely different types of formations:matrix acidizing is applied to high-permeability reservoirs,whereas acid fracturing is appropriate for low-permeability,acid-soluble reservoirs such as carbonates."}
{"text": "All stimulation practices adjust the skin effect,either by improving a negative component (fracturing)or by reducing a positive value caused by damage(matrix stimulation)[1]."}
{"text": "A classic concept introduced in 1957 [2]concluded that fractures are \"approximately perpendicular to the axis of least stress.\"The stress field can be decomposed into three principal axes:a vertical and two horizontal,which are unequal.For most reservoirs the minimum stress is horizontal,resulting in vertical hydraulic fractures."}
{"text": "Equation 6.5.2 can be evaluated using a density log.In its absence,a value of 1.1 psi/ft.can be used as a reasonable approximation."}
{"text": "Although the absolute and effective overburden stress can be computed via Equations 6.5.3 and 6.5.4,the two principal horizontal stresses are more complicated and their determination requires either field or laboratory measure- ments."}
{"text": "For sandstone formations,the Poisson ratio is approxi- mately equal to 0.25,leading to a value of approxi- mately equal to .For most shales the Poisson ratio is larger,leading to abrupt changes in the horizontal stress profile.This variation,which can envelope a sandstone reservoir because of overlaying and underlaying shales, is the single most important reason for fracture height containment."}
{"text": "● OB—This is the weight of the overburden which (suit- ably corrected for water depth)seldom varies too much from 1.0 to 1.05 psi/ft (0.022 to 0.023 MPa/m)."}
{"text": "The definition of principal stress direction implies that all shear stresses vanish.Thus,when a vertical well is drilled,usually it coincides with a principal stress direction. This is not the case when a deviated or horizontal well is drilled (unless,in the latter case,the well is drilled in the direction of one of the principal horizontal stresses). However,for the mass of deviated wells that are drilled from platforms or drilling pads,their direction implies a nonvanishing shear stress [3].The implications for frac- turing are substantial.A deviated well requires a higher fracture initiation pressure.Furthermore,the production performance of a fractured deviated well is impaired.This point will be addressed in a later subsection."}
{"text": "The pressure response during fracture closure is gov- erned largely by the rate of fluid loss.The analysis of pressure during this period estimates the fluid efficiency and the leakoff coefficient.These parameters are determined from a plot of the pressure decline versus a specialized function of time,commonly referred to as the G-plot.This specialized plot provides the fracturing analog to the Hormer plot for welltesting."}
{"text": "6.5.1.5 Determination of Closure Pressure\n\nClosure pressure is defined as the pressure when the frac- ture width becomes zero.In a homogenous reservoir and where oH,min is the smallest stress,the closure pressure is approximately equal to this value.Nolte [5,6]pioneered the analysis of the pressure response during fracture cali- bration treatments and the calculation of important fracture variables."}
{"text": "Another method for determining fracture closure pres- sure is called the \"equilibrium test\".This is an injection test similar to the conventional pump-in/shut-in/decline,with one exception:instead of shutting in the well,the fluid continues to be injected at a small rate,as illustrated in Fig.6.5.6.The treating pressure will initially decline as in the conventional shut-in decline because the new injection rate will approach or even be less than the leak-off rate. The fracture volume and the pressure will decrease with time as more fluid leaks off than is injected.This will result in the fracture volume being sufficiently reduced,and therefore,the fracture length will recede as the fracture approaches closure.The leak-off rate will decrease with time,and eventually,the leak-off rate and the injection rate q become equal.At that time,the fracture volume will stop decreasing,and the wellbore pressure will flat- ten out and start increasing.The minimum pressure when rate equilibrium is reached will be called the equilibrium pressure."}
{"text": "The equilibrium pressure Peq is an upper bound of the closure pressure Pc.By subtracting the instantaneous pressure change at the final shut-in,△Psi,any remaining pressure relating to friction or tortuosity is removed.The corrected equilibrium pressure,Peq-△Psi,differs from closure pressure only by the net pressure in the fracture, which should be relatively small because the rate q is small and therefore provides a direct approximation of closure pressure."}
{"text": "The stress-sensitive filtercake resistance is equivalent to a skin-effect and can therefore be incorporated as a component of the linear flow from the fracture into the reservoir."}
{"text": "6.5.1.7 Pressure Interpretation After Fracture Closure\n\nAnother application of pressure evaluation pertains to the pressure response after fracture closure.The pressure dur- ing this period reflects the transient reservoir response to fracturing and is independent of the mechanisms goveming fracture propagation.Its character is determined entirely by the response of a reservoir disturbed by the fluid- leakoff process.During this period,the reservoir may ini- tially exhibit formation linear flow,followed by transitional behavior and finally long-term pseudoradial flow."}
{"text": "The afterclosure response is similar to the behavior observed during a conventional well test of a propped fracture.It therefore supports an evaluation methodology analogous to the established principles of pressure transient evaluation.The afterclosure period provides information that is traditionally determined by a standard well test(i.e., transmissibility and reservoir pressure).It completes a chain of fracture pressure analysis that provides a continuum of increasing data for developing a unique characterization of the fracturing process.Nolte et al.[70]and Mayerhofer et al."}
{"text": "6.5.1.8 Properties of Fracturing Fluids\n\nThe expected functions of the fracturing fluid are to initiate and propagate the fracture and to transport the proppant with minimum leakoff and minimum treating pressure."}
{"text": "Fluid viscosity is thus critical.An ideal fracturing fluid should have relatively low viscosity in the tubing(sufficient to carry proppant through the surface equipment but low enough to avoid unnecessary friction pressure losses),and high viscosity within the fracture where a large value can provide bigger fracture width and transport the prop- pant efficiently down the fracture.However,what a high- viscosity fracturing fluid does,inadvertently,is to plug the high permeability of the propped fracture,creating a highly unfavourable mobility.A mechanism to reduce the viscosity after the job to a very low value is then necessary.How are these apparently contradictory demands accomplished?\n\nA typical,water-base fracturing fluid consists of water and a thickening polymer such as guar or one of the guar derivatives such as hydroxypropyl guar (HPG)or carboxymethylhydroxypropyl guar(CMHPG).The poly- mer concentrations could vary from 15 to 801b/1000 gal, depending on the required viscosity."}
{"text": "Recently polymer-free,water-base fracturing fluids have been developed using viscoelastic surfactants(VESs).Sur- factants,when added to water,will associate into structures called micelles.The surfactants used to create VES fluids form rodlike micelles that will associate with one another at a sufficient concentration,and the resulting hindered movement causes the fluid to become both viscous and elastic."}
{"text": "In addition to water-based fluids,there are other types of fracturing fluids.Oil-based fluids were the first fluids to be used.They can be thickened via an associative mechanism using an aluminum-phosphate ester polymer chain.How- ever,oil-based fluids are expensive to use and dangerous to handle due to their flammability.Hence,they are applied to formations that are perceived to be particularly water sensitive.Multiphase fluids such as emulsions (oil and water)and foams(gas and water)have been used widely."}
{"text": "For all fracturing fluids,the viscous properties of the fluid must be reduced or \"broken\"after the treatment. Unfortunately,the polymer chains concentrate throughout the treatment as the base liquid leaks off to the formation. The concentrated polymer is very difficult to completely break down,even in the presence of breakers.Different combinations of crosslinkers and polymers can be more resistant than others,leading to only partial decomposition, which can result in significant residue and therefore damage to the proppant pack.This phenomenon can lead to substan- tial proppant pack permeability damage with devastating effects on the fractured well performance."}
{"text": "For polymer fluids,breakers such as oxidative com- pounds(e.g.,peroxydisulfates)or enzymes(e.g.,hemicel- lulase)are used to reduce the length of the polymer chains and their molecular weight.These same breakers will also be added to emulsions and foams to degrade the polymer stabilizers in the water phase.VES fluids are broken by simply destabilizing the rodlike micelle structure.This may be accomplished by simply producing well fluids,either hydrocarbons or formation water,and mixing these fluids with the treating fluid.External breakers may also be added to the VES fluids to accelerate the viscosity degradation and facilitate cleanup immediately after the treatment."}
{"text": "Foams,emulsions,and VES fluids are generally con- sidered to be less damaging to the proppant pack than conventional polymer-based fluids.Foams and emulsions use significantly less polymer due to the addition of the gas or hydrocarbon phase.With less polymer present,the potential for damage is minimized.VES fluids contain no solids,so once the viscosity is reduced,there will virtually no permeability reduction to the proppant pack."}
{"text": "Proppant size is also important.Larger grain sizes result in larger fracture permeability.However,larger sizes are more susceptible to crushing as stresses increases,and the relative reduction in the pack permeability is much larger in the larger-size proppants.Reference[14]contains a number of correlations for size and size distribution effects on proppant pack permeability."}
{"text": "The resin fush technique involves pumping a curable resin into the fracture at the end of the job.The resin coats the proppant in the fracture near the wellbore and forms a bond that glues the individual proppant grains together while still maintaining most of the permeability\n\nA curable resin coating may also be applied to sand or other types of proppants to prevent the flowback of prop- pants near the wellbore.The curable-resin-coated prop- pants are mixed and pumped in the later stages of the treatment,and the well is shut in for a period of time to allow the resin to bind the proppant particles together.Under sufficient closure stress,shut-in time,and temperature,the resin-coated proppant cures into a consolidated,but perme- able,proppant pack that resists flowback."}
{"text": "6.5.1.10 Propped Fracture Design\n\nThe previous information was intended to serve as background information for propped fracture design."}
{"text": "For a given formation,the lithology,temperature,and reservoir fluids would dictate the choice of the fracturing fluid while the state of stress and the desired fractured performance would point toward the proppant selection. A fracture propagation simulator may then describe the fracture geometry.There are several types of simulators including fully three-dimensional(3D),planar 3D(PL3D), pseudo 3D(P3D)(coupled 3D fracture and two dimension [2D]fluid flow),and the classic analytical 2D models. The latter include the PKN model (Perkins and Kern [17]; Nordgren [18])and the KGD model(Khristianovich and Zheltov [19];Geertsma and de Klerk [20])."}
{"text": "The higher the complexity of the simulation,the higher the demand for appropriate data and the longer the sim- ulation time.For the purpose of this exercise,the ele- gant,analytical PKN and KGD models will be used."}
{"text": "Thus the fracture geometry can be determined and,with the imposed limits,a treatment optimization may be done."}
{"text": "The area Af is total fracture area and is equal to 4xfhf."}
{"text": "Equation 6.5.18 is a quadratic relationship for the square root of the injection time ti,and can be solved readily.Thus, the product qiti can be calculated,representing the total amount of fluid Vi required to generate a fracture of the calculated geometric and leakoff features."}
{"text": "Assuming also that the treating pressure must be kept below a certain level to avoid migration,then a PKN-type fracture can be propagated at constant net pressure.This can be accomplished by decreasing the fluid viscosity or the injection rate as can be concluded from Equation 6.5.23. Given the choice,treatment optimization has shown that reduction in viscosity is more desirable than a reduction in injection rate."}
{"text": "The calculation of the fluid volume(Equation 6.5.17) and proppant mass requirements (Equation 6.5.21),injec- tion rates,and treatment pressures (Equation 6.5.25)lead to the calculation of the cost to create the fracture."}
{"text": "It is very easy step to integrate these rates into the cumulative production.The incremental cumulative produc- tion(above the one the unstimulated well could deliver) multiplied by the unit price of the hydrocarbons (oil or gas)and discounted to time zero is the present value of the incremental revenue."}
{"text": "Historically,the KGD model[19,20]preceded the PKN model.It is also based on the pressurized crack solution but applied in the horizontal direction.There are additional differences,that is,the pressure drop equation is written for a channel with rectangular cross section and the existence of a nonwetted(nonpressurized)zone is assumed near the tip."}
{"text": "A width equation such as Equation 6.5.16 or 6.5.17 leaves only one degree of freedom for the geometry of the fracture.If we give(directly or indirectly)the fracture volume,the shape is determined.The additional information on the fracture volume is provided through the material balance."}
{"text": "If we want to apply the above equation,we have to decide how to estimate the constant width in this relation."}
{"text": "The combination of Equation 6.5.31 with one of the width equations results in a system that is completely determined if either the length or the injection time is given. For the solution,simple iterative methods can be applied."}
{"text": "The use of Equation 6.5.31 is somewhat complicated."}
{"text": "6.5.1.11.3 Detailed Models\n\nClearly,the short-cut 2D models are based on several approximations,some of those being contradictory.For example,the geometric picture behind the Carter equation (and behind the upper and lower bounds)would require a fracture propagating with a constant width.The PKN or KGD width equations,on the other hand,give width changing in time as well."}
{"text": "Nordgren [18]presented a constant-height model in the form of a partial differential equation that contains coherent assumptions on the geometry.Kemp [23]showed the correct tip boundary condition for Nordgren's equation. Interestingly,the numerical solution does not differ much from the one of the PKN models.The main reason is that in both the detailed Nordgren model and the PKN versions, the fracture tip propagation rate is controlled by the linear velocity of the fluid at the tip.In other words,in these models there is no mechanism to hamper the opening of the fracture faces once the fluid arrives there.This latter statement is valid also for the different KGD variations."}
{"text": "Appearance of irregular pressure profiles and posttreat- ment observation of fracture height growth initiated adepar- ture from the ideal geometry assumptions.This generated higher dimensional models and prompted the introduction of improved calculation procedures.The two most impor- tant concepts are the vertical distribution of the (minimum horizontal)stress and the fracture toughness."}
{"text": "P3D models are used routinely nowadays for the design of fracturing treatments,in real time during the actual treatment,and for postjob evaluation.There are two broad categories of P3D models:cell-based and lumped:\n\n● Lumped models assume that the fracture consists of two half-ellipses of variable half-heights,joined along a horizontal line in the fracture length direction.At each time step,the fracture length tip and top and bottom tips are calculated as part of the solution."}
{"text": "● Cell-based models assume that the fracture is divided into a number of PKN cells along the fracture length direction.At each time step,the fracture length and height of each cell is computed as part of the solution."}
{"text": "Regardless of the numerical scheme employed,P3D mod- els are more powerful than the simpler PKN-type models because they allow limited height growth as part of the solution,thereby expanding the range of treatments that can be designed and monitored."}
{"text": "There are also a limited number of noncommercial \"truly\"3D models available that allow nonplanar fracture growth (i.e.,limited twisting and turning of the fracture). However,these models are currently prohibitively expen- sive to exercise,even for research purposes,and do not generally address transverse or longitudinal shear failure that will naturally arise as soon as nonplanar fracture growth is allowed."}
{"text": "Many fracturing treatments are performed in reservoirs that exhibit highly nonlinear or plastic-like material behav- ior,such as in the Gulf of Mexico.The current linear elastic models(whether P3D,PL3D,PKN,KGD,or radial) need to be adapted to cope with these plastic deformations. Fracturing treatments performed in such soft formations are expected to generate more fracture width and different pressure responses compared with fractures injected in com- petent rock.Possible remedies include the implementation of a fracture growth criterion in current models that are based on continuum damage mechanics theory [27]or the theory of plasticity [28]."}

{"text": "Primarily,two items should be examined:\n\n● Fracture height migration—this can be done via a post- treatment temperature or radioactive log."}
{"text": "● Fracture permeability reduction—this could be the result of proppant pack damage or a choke(overdisplacement or other reasons that reduce the contact between well and fracture).Assessment of the geometric and conduc- tivity characteristics of the fracture can be done via a postttreatment pressure transient test using the model outlined in Reference [21]."}
{"text": "6.5.1.12 Acid Fracturing\n\nAcid fracturing is a stimulation process in which acid, usually hydrochloric acid (HCl),is injected into a limestone (CaCO₃)or dolomite(CaMgCO₃)formation at a pressure sufficient to fracture the formation.As the acid flows along the fracture,portions of the fracture face are dissolved. The flowing acid tends to etch in a nonuniform manner, creating conductive channels that will remain after the fracture closes and ultimately will provide the necessary fracture conductivity.The length of the etched fracture is determined by the acid type,strength,volume,leakoff parameters,reaction rate,and spending rate."}
{"text": "There are certain comparative advantages and disad- vantages of acid fractures(versus propped fractures)in carbonate reservoirs."}
{"text": "● In very low permeability formations in which long fracture lengths are required,propped fractures will be preferred.In acid fracturing,the acid-based fracturing fluid is continually spending and therefore is consumed as the fracture penetrates deeper into the reservoir.This results in fracture half-lengths that may be limited to a few hundred feet,especially as the temperature of the reservoir increases [30]."}
{"text": "● Operationally,acid fracturing has several advantages over propped fracturing,including 1)the addition of proppant is eliminated,thereby greatly simplifying the pumping execution process;2)problems related to screenouts are eliminated;3)proppant cleanout from the wellbore after the treatment is not necessary;and\n\n4)no proppant production problems are encountered when production begins."}
{"text": "spent or lost to the matrix to fluid loss.Controlling fluid loss is a difficult challenge because the acid is continuously reacting with the fracture face and increasing the fracture face permeability.Flow channels,called wormholes,will develop,which will greatly increase the effective area where leakoff can take place."}
{"text": "Wormholes form due to heterogeneity within the rock."}
{"text": "Controlling leakoff becomes a challenge due to the acid continually reacting with the fracture face and removing any filtercake that is laid down,plus the formation of worm- holes.To overcome this problem,many acid fracture treat- ments are design to pump alternating stages of nonreactive viscous pad fluid and acid.The initial viscous pad promotes viscous fingering of the acid that follows.The selective acid flow increases penetration and tends to create etched flow channels that provide good conductivity.Subsequent stages of the viscous fluid will reestablish any filtercake removed by the acid and also flow into and plug off the excessive leakoff associated with wormholes.Crosslinked acid systems have also shown to be very effective at con- trolling excessive leakoff.These systems are designed to crosslink upon acid spending,which limits the creation of wormholes [33]."}
{"text": "Acid and oil emulsion fluids have been designed for use in high temperature wells to reduce the acid reaction rate,which aids in getting live acid to the tip of the fracture.These emulsions are generally oil-external-phase and provide the retarding properties because the oil phase physically separates the acid from the reactive carbonate surface [34]."}

{"text": "the horizontal well lengths to be more than doubled from those reported above."}
{"text": "However,reservoirs with βh≤25 ft are normally natu- rally fractured.Although the theoretically optimum fracture half-lengths may require certain equivalent horizontal well lengths,actual fracture executions may not deliver the desired fracture lengths.Screenouts because of excessive leakoff or the opening of fissures normal to the hydraulic fracture trajectory may prevent the creation of these lengths. Thus,horizontal wells may be good alternatives to vertical wells with propped fractures in cases in which fracture length willbe limited."}
{"text": "Finally,horizontal permeability anisotropy is exception- ally important.In moderately to highly anisotropic forma- tions,horizontal wells can be good substitutes for fractured vertical wells."}
{"text": "Of particular importance is the third comparison,which allows the possibility to drill the horizontal well either in the direction that would result in transverse fractures or in the\n\ndirection that would result in largely longitudinal(parallel) fractures.A comprehensive review of the issue has been presented by McLennan et al.[37]."}
{"text": "The drilling of a highly deviated or horizontal well(that does not coincide with a principal stress axis)results in a nonvanishing shear stress component.This was addressed in an earlier subsection,and it frequently implies additional pressure requirements for fracture initiation.The fracturing pressure of horizontal wells is affected by the stress concen- trations near the well given by [38]."}
{"text": "Because in highly deviated wells the direction of frac- ture initiation is likely to differ from the ultimate direc- tion of propagation,this turning of the fracture direc- tion can have major implications during fracture execution (screenouts as a result of inadequate width“around a bend\")and a choked fracture for the production after the treatment."}
{"text": "A most attractive element is the option to drill a hori- zontal well in the direction of minimum horizontal stress (i.e.,transverse fractures willbe initiated)or in the direction of maximum horizontal stress (i.e.,a longitudinal fracture will be initiated).In Reference [37],guidelines are given to decide on either of these two options."}
{"text": "The base case is a vertical well with a vertical fracture."}
{"text": "If FCD>10,then a horizontal well with transverse orthogonal fractures is indicated.If FCD<2,a horizontal well with a colinear,longitudinal,fracture is indicated.For FCD values between 2 and 10,a more detailed calculation is needed.This is a gain outlined in Reference [37]."}
{"text": "In all cases the decision to drill a horizontal well instead of a vertical well must be done on the basis of NPV calculations.The incremental performance,if any,must cover the incremental cost of drilling the horizontal well."}
{"text": "6.5.2 Matrix Stimulation\n\nMatrix stimulation is the process of injecting a fluid,either an acid or a solvent,into a well at a pressure below the fracturing pressure.For sandstone reservoirs this type of treatment will simply attempt to remove the damage and restore the natural permeability,whereas in carbonates,the damage is not only removed but may also be bypassed by creating new highly conductive channels called wormholes."}
{"text": "Any damage around the near wellbore region may severely reduce the production or injection rate of a well. This damage,which may have a variety of origins,may also be of different type and nature and can be characterized as either natural or induced.Natural damages include fines migration,swelling clays,water-formed scales,and organic deposits,such as paraffins or asphaltenes.Induced damages form after the injection or leakoff of a fluid and include plugging from solids or polymers,wettability changes, water blocks,emulsions,and bacterial growth."}

{"text": "6.5.2.1.3 Diversion In Matrix Acidizing\n\nThe placement of treating fluids into all zones of interest, especially those that are damaged,is a significant challenge. Successful matrix treatments depend on the uniform vertical distribution of the treatment fluid over the entire production (or injection)interval.When acid is pumped into a well, it naturally tends to flow into the highest permeability or zone with the least amount of damage(or both)and through the open perforations.Improper placement of acid between regions of different injectivities can be avoided by using diversion techniques."}
{"text": "During drilling and well completion,mud filtrate and completion fluids penetrate the pay zone.Because the expo- sure time of the formation to drilling and completion fluids is longer at the horizontal section nearer the vertical section, the shape of damage distribution along the wellbore will be a truncated cone,with the larger base near the vertical section of the well.This profile of damage is evident also during production,because the pressure gradient normal to the well nearer the vertical section is (usually)the largest."}
{"text": "Horizontal wells have such long exposed intervals that stimulation fluid volumes per unit length used in vertical wells are not practical.While pumping as much as 150 gal/ft.is routine in vertical wells,such coverage implies 300,000 gal of acid in a 2000-ft.horizontal well.Pumping at 1 bpm,these volumes would require 120 hours of pumping."}
{"text": "Afurther constraint is proper placing of acid(diversion): acid has a tendency to extend existing flow paths.Thus, acid thief zones are either natural or created,and there is therefore a need for substantial optimization of matrix stim- ulation in terms of technical and economic considerations."}
{"text": "When planning for a partial removal of the damage,the distribution of the stimulation fluid is a crucial issue.A simple calculation of posttreatment skin effect determines that the distribution of the stimulation fluid should mimic the shape of damage.Deliberate blanking of horizontal well segments and complete damage removal in the perforated sections offer another potential for significant optimization of the stimulation treatment."}
{"text": "The previous considerations require a methodology of acid placement.Bull-heading the fluids into the horizontal portion is not recommended.Such treatments stimulate only a minor portion of the horizontal well,usually near the heal.Coiled tubing is a proper tool for the distribution of stimulation fluids.After the coiled tubing is run to the toe of the well,the stimulation fluid can be pumped as the coiled tubing is concurrently withdrawn.The rate of coiled tubing withdrawal can be calculated and depends on the injection rate and volumetric coverage.In addition,new jetting tools placed on the end of the coiled tubing have proven to be very effective at ensuring acid coverage over long intervals [49]."}

{"text": "● Scrubber or Gas Knockout—a vessel designed to han- dle streams of high gas/liquid ratios.The liquid is generally entrained as mist in the gas or is free,flowing along the pipe wall.These vessels usually have a small liquid collection section.The terms scrubber and knock- out are used interchangeably.Typically,these are high- pressure vessels.Gases in the retrograde condensate regime require additional design consideration to ensure additional liquids are not produced due to pressure drop."}
{"text": "● Three-Phase Separator—a vessel used to separate gas and two immiscible liquids of different densities (eg., gas,oil,and water).Typically,these vessels are low pressure but can just as easily be designed for high\n\npressures."}
{"text": "● Filter Separator—These separators usually have two compartments.The first contains flter/coalescing ele- ments.As the gas flows through the elements,the liquid particles coalesce into larger droplets,and when the droplets reach sufficient size,the gas flow causes them to flow out of the filter elements into the center core.The particles are then carried into the second compartment of the vessel(containing a vane-type or knitted wire mesh mist extractor)where the larger droplets are removed. A filter separator can also be designed with the primary separation section upstream of the coalescing section if the incoming gas contains a large amount of liquid or the exiting gas must be extremely dry.A lower barrel or boot may be used for surge or storage of the removed liquid."}
{"text": "● Line Drip—Typically used in pipelines with very high gas/liquid ratios to remove only free liquid from the gas stream and not necessarily all the liquid from a gas stream.Line drips provide a place for free liquids to separate and accumulate.Typically,these are high- pressure vessels."}

{"text": "● Expansion Vessel—A first-stage separator on a low- temperature or cold-separation unit.This vessel may be equipped with a heating core to melt hydrates,or a hydrate-preventative liquid(such as glycol or methanol) may be injected into the well fluid just before expansion into this vessel."}
{"text": "● Desanders—A high-pressure vessel that is installed on some gas wells to \"catch\"any sand that is produced along with the gas.This sand may be from a frac job, or it may be from the formation.The pressure drop at the desander allows the majority of this sand to drop out at a controlled location rather than in the lines,at measurement points,or in production equipment."}
{"text": "6.6.2 Pressure Vessel Relief Systems\n\nAll pressure vessels are to be equipped with a pressure relief valve set to open at a pressure no greater than the maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP)of that vessel and sized to prevent pressure from rising more than 10%or 3 psi,whichever is greater,above the MAWP at full open flow.For vessels with multiple relief valves,16%or 4 psi,whichever is greater,above the MAWP is allowed. This provision DOES NOT apply to relief valve/rupture disk combinations.Pressure vessels operating at pressures above 125 psig may be equipped with a rupture disk or a second (redundant)relief valve.The rupture disk should be designed to rupture at not more than 15%above the MAWP and sized to handle the maximum flow through the vessel. Relief valves and rupture disks should be installed in the gaseous phase of a vessel,and be placed so that there is no restriction between the valve and the vessel.A locking handle full-opening ball valve can be installed below the relief valve but must remain locked in the open position.The installation of this isolation valve is so that the relief valve can be tested in place or replaced without having to take the vessel out of service to do so.Vessels that operate in a fluid- packed state should be equipped with an appropriately sized liquid service relief valve."}
{"text": "All new pressure vessels should be designed and con- structed per ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code,Sec- tion VIII.It is up to the purchaser if the vessel is to be certified and registered by the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors [8];in critical service,this may be worth the extra time and expense to obtain a National Board Number and the associated paperwork.It is imperative that all the construction drawings,steel mill reports,and the U1A form that is provided by the ASME Code Shop/Fabricator be filed in a Central Filing System. Those records are required to be maintained and accessible as part of the Code requirements.Any subsequent repair or alterations made to the vessel are to be documented and filed as well.It is suggested that a unique company number be assigned to each vessel and cold stamped into a vessel leg or skirt,as nameplates can be damaged or removed over time,especially if equipment is moved from one location to another.This unique number allows for maintaining the records from cradle to grave for each vessel."}

{"text": "6.6.2.1.2 Tank Venting\n\nAll tank venting designs should be in accordance to API 2000 Standard.Oil and gas production operation tanks should be provided with both normal and emergency vent- ing.Normal venting is typically addressed with deadweight pressure/vacuum valves.The weight is determined by the design of the tank.Tanks used for production operations typically have vent valves set at 4 oz.Emergency venting is addressed with gauge hatch covers and,if necessary, additional weighted covers.The normal operation vents must work in conjunction with the gas blanket and the vapor recovery unit(VRU)(more information on VRUs is found in“Compressors”),if installed to minimize tank emissions and blanket gas utilization.Frangible deck joints are recommended on larger tanks.These should be con- structed according to API 650 with full penetration welds to facilitate internal coating of the tank."}
{"text": "6.6.2.1.3 Gas Blankets\n\nGas blankets should be used in order to minimize the possibility of an explosive atmosphere in water tanks,to prevent oxygenation of produced water,and to prevent air at the intake of a VRU if the controls fail.Gas blankets must work in coordination with the VRU and normal tank venting.Normal relief pressures should be at the widest range permissible by tank design.The source of gas for a gas blanket is typically a residue gas system,which also provides \"clean\"gas for fired equipment or may come off of the gas scrubber in the facility."}
{"text": "ReciprocatingPD pumps are available in four designs:\n\n● Simplex—This pump has a single liquid cylinder that forces liquid out through the top outlet on both the in and the out stroke (here up and down).This basic type of pump might be used for air pumps,feed pumps for the furnace,fire,bilge,and fuel oil service."}
{"text": "Piping design should carefully address the suction-side pipe hydraulics.It is critical to provide adequate Net Positive Suction Head(NPSH)to avoid cavitation and vibration problems.The use of suction and discharge pulsation dampeners is strongly recommended.Suction lines should be sized to limit the velocity to less than 5 ft./s,and discharge piping should include a relief valve and check valve upstream of the discharge block valve.The relief valve should be piped back to a tank to avoid spills\n\nVibration is of major concern with PD pumps;mechan- ical vibration and structural stress can result in failures and spills,and so pulsation dampeners,valves,etc.should be supported.OSHA requires guards to be placed over plungers and belts."}
{"text": "6.6.2.2.3 Compressors\n\nCompression in the oil field ranges from low-pressure sliding vane compressor to 2500+high-pressure integral units.Compressors are used to boost the pressure from the wellhead or the facility to sales line pressure,to inject gas back into the reservoir for pressure maintenance or enhanced oil recovery(CO₂,nitrogen,etc.),or boost the pressure from the wellhead or facility to a central facility. Depending upon the size and the field conditions/location, they may be powered by electric motors,gas/internal com- bustion or by turbine engines.VRUs are the most common use of compression in surface oil production.The larger compressors are addressed in“Compressor Stations”."}
{"text": "VRUs are installed for the economic recovery of tank vapors,compliance with Air Emission Regulations (Federal and/or State),and for safety considerations.Emissions can be estimated or measured prior to installation.The Texas Natural Resource Commission has allowed 90 days of temporary operation under Standard Exemption 67[12]to determine actual emissions.The majority of the VRUs on the market today use sliding vane rotary or screw com- pressors.Generally sliding vane compressors are used up to 4:1 compression ratios,screw compressors up to 10:1. Above 10:1 is a specialized application and a reciprocating compressor should also be considered."}
{"text": "Much of what is addressed is risk-based analysis\n\n● Carbon steel is the most commonly used material."}
{"text": "Bare carbon steel can be used for liquidhydrocarbon, steam,and gas service.Ifinternally coated,it can also be used in water and acid service."}
{"text": "● SS is used when increased corrosion protection is needed.The most commonly used ones in the oil field are 316 and 304.The low-carbon versions should be used if it is to be welded.The 316L and 304L do not become sensitized during welding;hence,do not require postweld heat-treating.316 SS is preferred in brine/salt water service,and 304 SS is may be used in wet CO₂service.Austenitic Stainless Steels are susceptible to several forms of stress corrosion cracking, especially chloride SCC.Care should be taken when selecting these materials where high temperature and/or concentrations are expected.Post Weld Heat Treatment or alternative materials such as lined carbon steel or composites should be considered."}
{"text": "● Polyethylene is commonly used due to its low cost,low weight,ease of installation,corrosion resistance,and flow characteristics.For the most part,it is not recom- mended for pressure above 100 psig or temperatures above 100°F,although there has been a lot of progress made in the characteristics.Poly pipe is most often used for gas gathering and flowlines,but it should be derated per manufacturer's recommendations when used in wet hydrocarbon service.Because of its composition, it should not be used to transport flammable fluids above ground."}
{"text": "6.6.2.3.2 Buried versus Above Ground\n\nOne of the first of these items to be addressed is whether the pipe is to be above ground or buried.OSHA requires that all nonmetallic or low-melting-point pipe carrying flammable materials to be buried.And whenever nonmetallic pipe is buried,detection tape or trace cable should be buried above the pipe to aid in locating the pipe in the future.Buried pipe may be more or less costly than aboveground systems. One should take into account the relative cost of the pipe, access,operational preferences,fire,freeze,mechanical protection,and pipe supports.It is recommended to exter- nally coat buried pipe to avoid external corrosion.Cathodic protection may be used instead of or in conjunction with external coating systems."}
{"text": "It is common to paint aboveground pipe for aesthetics as well as to provide some corrosion protection (this includes painting fiberglass pipe to protect it from UV degradation). Aboveground piping should be labeled for the type of service and carrier fluid.ASME A13.1\"Scheme for the Identification of Piping Systems\"can be referred to where color-coding and method of identification is required."}
{"text": "6.6.2.3.3 Internal Coatings and Linings\n\nSolids production and erosion can be detrimental to some internal coatings,so these as well as the specific service and considerations of environmental risk associated with a leak should be evaluated.In most cases,internal coating should be considered for all steel piping systems.There are many different products available;the ones most commonly found in the oil field are cement lining,plastic coating,and extruded polyethylene."}
{"text": "● Plug Valves—Plug valves are similar to gates and work particularly well in abrasive service.These are available either lubricated or nonlubricated."}
{"text": "● Ball Valves—Ball valves are quarter-turn,straight- through flow valves that use a round closure element with matching rounded elastometric seats that permit uniform sealing stress.These valves are limited to mod- erate temperature service (below 250℃)by the plastic seats that create a seal around the ball.The type of seat can vary with the valve pressure rating and materials of construction.Some valve seats are a single molded form,while other valve seats with higher-pressure rat- ings often incorporate a Trunion design where each face of the ball is sealed separately.They have found applications in flow control,as well as on/off use in isolating a pipe stream.The pressure drop across the valve in a fully open position is minimal for a full- port design.However,with restricted-port designs the pressure drop can be significant [13]."}
{"text": "● Check Valves—Check valves commonly used in pro- duction service are the swing,piston,or split disk styles. The swing check is used in low-velocity flows where flow reversals are infrequent.Piston checks with or with- out spring assists are used in high-flow rate streams with frequent reversals (i.e.,compressor or high-pressure pump discharges).Split disk checks are typically used in low-pressure applications in which a minimum pressure drop across the valve is required (i.e.,transfer/charge pump discharges).Because of the service,SS internals are preferred over plastic-coated in any service where they come in contact with produced water to minimize corrosion failures."}
{"text": "Materials used in valve construction are as varied as their applications.The following are the ones commonly used in the oil field.The material used in the valve body is addressed first.Valves carrying flammable fluids should be of steel or ductile iron."}
{"text": "6.6.2.4.1 Momentum\n\nFluid phases with different densities will have differ- ent momentum.If a two-phase stream changes direction sharply,greater momentum will not allow the particles of the heavier phase to turn as rapidly as the lighter fluid,so separation occurs.Momentum is usually employed for bulk separation of the two phases in a stream."}
{"text": "Cp=drag coefficient of particle(dimensionless)\n\nThe drag coefficient has been found to be a function of the shape of the particle and the Reynolds number of the flowing gas.For the purpose of this equation,particle shape is considered to be a solid,rigid sphere."}
{"text": "Horizontal separators are most often efficient for large volumes of total fluids and when large amounts of dissolved gases are present with the liquid.The greater liquid surface area provides for optimum conditions for releasing gas from the liquid."}
{"text": "Spherical separators are rarely used in production oper- ations."}
{"text": "6.6.4 Vertical Separators\n\nThe following calculations are presented as a guide to the design and sizing of two-phase separators.Sizing should be based on the maximum expected instantaneous rate."}

{"text": "6.6.6 Vessel Internals [18]\n\nThe proper selection of internals can significantly enhance the operation of separators.Proprietary internals often are helpful in reducing liquid carryover at design conditions. Nevertheless,they cannot overcome an improper design or operation at off-design conditions."}
{"text": "Production equipment involving the separation of oil and gas often uses impingement-type mist-extraction ele- ments.This element is usually of the vane type or of knitted wire."}
{"text": "As the plates are placed closer together and more pockets are provided,greater agitation,centrifugal force, and collection surface are provided,but the pressure drop is increased correspondingly.Thus,for a given flow rate, the collection efficiency is normally some function of the pressure drop."}
{"text": "In the average application,this pressure drop varies from 1.2 to 10 in.(3 to 25cm)of water.Because of this pressure drop and to prevent gas bypassing the extractor,a liquid- collection pas incorporating a liquid seal is necessary for the liquid to drain properly."}
{"text": "Increased use has been made of mist extractors com- posed of a knitted wire mesh supported on a lightweight support.This material has given generally favorable results and has a low installed cost."}
{"text": "The element consists of wire knitted into a pad having a number of unaligned,asymmetrical openings.Although similar in appearance to filter media,its action is somewhat different.The latter are rather dense and have small open- ings.This knitted wire,on the other hand,has about 97% to 98%free voids and collects the particles primarily by impingement."}
{"text": "The material is available in single wound units of varying thicknesses in diameter up to 35 in.(90 cm)or in laminated strips for insertion through manholes in large process vessels."}
{"text": "The principle of separation is similar to that of the vane- type unit.The gas flowing through the pad is forced to change direction a number of times,although centrifugal action is not so pronounced.Impingement is the primary mechanism."}
{"text": "Aliquid particle striking the metal surface,which it does not \"wet,\"flows downward where adjacent wires provide some capillary space.At these points,liquid collects and continues to flow downward.Surface tension tends to hold these drops on the lower face of the pad until they are large enough for the downward force of gravity to exceed that of the upward gas velocity and surface tension."}
{"text": "Efficiency is a function of the number of targets pre-\n\nsented.This may be accomplished by increasing the pad thickness,changing wire diameter,or the closeness of the weave."}
{"text": "Any common metal may be used in these units,includ- ing carbon steel,SS,aluminum,monel,etc.The pressure drop is a function of the entrainment load,the pad design, and gas velocity but will not exceed 3cm of water in the average insulation.Because of this small pressure drop,the elements do not have to be \"held down\"and are normally only wired to the support grid to prevent shifting unless surging flow is anticipated."}
{"text": "Experience has shown that the support grid should con- tain at least 90%free area in order to eliminate any restric- tions to liquid drainage.The pads are light in weight so that a light angle-iron support is adequate.When both liquid and solids are presenta portion of the latter obviously will be scrubbed out.If only dry solids are present,the efficiency of this design is substantially less.Many vessel carryover problems are encountered.Foaming is a major culprit and requires more than simply better mist extraction.Most such problems develop by default.The vendor automatically uses the standard sizing curves and equipment,and the buyer assumes this will be good enough."}
{"text": "With glycols,amines,and similar materials,which tend to foam,a dual mist extractor would normally be specified—the lower one being of the vane type and the upper one being a wire mesh.A space of 6 to 12 in.(15 to 30 cm)would be left between them.The vane type will handle large volumes of liquid but is relatively inefficient on small droplets.It,therefore,serves as a bulk removal device(and helps to coalesce foam).The wire mesh,which has limited liquid capacity,may therefore operate more effectively."}
{"text": "When using the vane-type mist extractor,one must be careful that the pressure drop across it does not exceed the height above the liquid level if a downcomer pipe is used. Otherwise,liquid willbe\"sucked out\"overhead.The down- comer pipe can become partially plugged to accentuate the problem.Two wire mesh pads may be used in like fashion, with the first being used as a coalescer.As a rule of thumb, the coalescer pad should have about half the free space area of the second pad.Any wire mesh pad should be installed so that the flow is perpendicular to the pad face (pad is horizontal in a vertical vessel)."}
{"text": "With a given system,the size of particle collected is inversely proportional to the square root of the velocity. Consequently,the success of a cyclonic mist extractor is dependent upon the velocity attained.Furthermore,the velocity needed to separate a given size of particle must increase,as the density of the particle becomes less.In addi- tion to producing the necessary velocity,the mist extractor must provide an efficient means of collecting and removing the particles collected in order to prevent re-entrainment."}
{"text": "One common type of equipment is often called a steam separator because it has been widely used to separate condensate and pipe scale in steam systems.Normally,a relatively small vessel imparts a high velocity to the incom- ing gas and then makes the gas change direction radically to prevent re-entrainment.In general,it will separate particles 40 microns and larger very efficiently."}
{"text": "Another type uses the same principle but,in addition, forces the gas to pass through a labyrinth that introduces impingement effects and forces the gas to change direction a number of times.This is,in reality,a combination type and is relatively efficient.The general performance characteris- tics are the same as efficient mist extractors of other types. Some,however,are complex and relatively expensive."}
{"text": "● Gas velocity must be lowered to allow liquids to drop out."}
{"text": "● Gas is then scrubbed through an efficient mist extractor."}
{"text": "● Water and oil must be diverted to a turbulence-free section of the vessel."}
{"text": "● Liquids must be retained in the vessel long enough to allow separation."}
{"text": "● The water-oil interface must be maintained."}

{"text": "6.6.8 Two-Stage Separation Systems\n\nIn high-pressure gas-condensate separation systems,it is generally accepted that a stepwise reduction of the pres- sure on the liquid condensate will appreciably increase the recovery of stock tank liquids.The calculation of the actual performance of the various separators in amultistage system can be made,using the initial wellstream composition and the operating temperatures and pressures of the various stages.Theoretically,three or four stages of separation would increase the liquid recovery over two stages:the net increase over two-stage separation will rarely pay out the cost of the second and/or third separator.Therefore,it has been generally accepted that two stages of separation plus the stock tank are the most optimum considered.The actual increase in liquid recovery for two-stage separation over single stage may vary from 3%to 15%(sometimes even more)depending upon the wellstream composition, operating pressures and temperatures."}
{"text": "The optimum high stage or first separator operating pressure is generally governed by the gas transmission line pressure and operating characteristics of the well.This will generally range in pressure from 600 to 1200 psia(41.4 to 82.7 bar).For each high or first-stage pressure,there is an optimum low-stage separation pressure that will afford the maximum liquid recovery.This operating pressure can be determined from an equation based on equal pressure ratios between the stages."}
{"text": "operated at atmospheric pressure.Due to increased environ- mental consideration,a tank VRU is typically required to capture flash gases.This is typically routed to the LP gas system."}
{"text": "Example 6.6.5\n\nPerform flash vaporization calculation to determine the increase recoveries that would be seen in both low-pressure flash gas as well as increased liquid recoveries in the storage tank.High-pressure gas SGg=0.67,the high-pressure separator pressures from 500 to 1,000 psi,the low-pressure separator P=100 psi,and the storage tank pressure Ps= 14.7 psia.Temperature for allvessels is the same,70°F."}
{"text": "This additional recovery not only gives profit but also prevents the unneeded waste of precious hydrocarbon energy that would normally be vented out the stock tank using only single-stage separation."}
{"text": "An emulsion is a heterogeneous liquid system consisting of two immiscible liquids with one of the liquids intimately disposed in the form of droplets in the second liquid (the water remaining is less than 10%of the oil).A common method for separating water-oil emulsion is to heat the stream.The use of heat in treating crude oil emulsions has four basic benefits:\n\n1.Heat reduces the viscosity of the oil,making coalescence of droplets easier."}
{"text": "2.Heat increases the droplets'molecular movement."}
{"text": "3.Heat can enhance the action of treating chemicals, causing the chemicals to work faster to break the film surrounding the droplets of the dispersed phase of the emulsion."}
{"text": "4.Heat may increase the difference in density between the oil and the water,thus accelerating settling."}
{"text": "In general,at temperatures below 180°F(82°℃),the addi- tion of heat will increase the difference in density.Most light oils are treated below 180°F.For heavy crudes (below 20°APD),heat may have a negative effect on difference in density."}
{"text": "high-corrosive fluids and are more expensive than direct fired heaters but have an advantage when considering fire safety due to tube rupture."}
{"text": "Heat exchangers are very useful where waste heat is recovered from an engine,turbine,or other process stream or where fired heaters are prohibited."}
{"text": "full-load temperature difference between the fire tube wall and the surrounding oil is approximately 30°F,allowing 10°F for safety;the 40°rule will prevent flashing of steam on the wall of the heating tube."}
{"text": "A water bath temperature must be assumed for the calculations as mentioned before.Usually 180°F is the maximum designed temperature recommended for indirect water bath heaters."}
{"text": "For settling temperature 150°F,the minimum effective length has to be 2.7 ft.if(tr)o=20 min and 3.4 ft. if(tr)o=15 min.At lower settling temperature,Leff should be 24 and 32 ft.for(tr)o=20 min and 15 min, respectively."}

{"text": "Hydrates normally form when a gas stream is cooled below its hydrate formation temperature.At high pressure these solids may form at temperatures well above 32°F."}
{"text": "Hydrate formation is almost always undesirable because the crystals may cause plugging of flow lines,chokes, valves,and instrumentation;reduce line capacities;or cause physical damage."}
{"text": "The two major conditions that promote hydrate for- mation are,the gas being at the appropriate pressure and temperature and the gas being at or below its water dew point with \"free water\"present.As pressure increasesthe hydrate formation temperature also increases.If there is no free water present,hydrates cannot form [4]."}
{"text": "Therefore,the gas may be expanded to atmospheric pressure without hydrate formation."}
{"text": "All molecules too large to form hydrate,e.g.,nitrogen and helium have a K-value of infinity."}
{"text": "Temperature at which hydrate will form is about 54°F."}

{"text": "Inhibition utilizes injection of one of the glycols or methanol to lower the hydrate formation temperature for a given pressure."}
{"text": "Ethylene,diethylene,and triethylene glycols have been used for glycol injection.The most popular has been ethy- lene glycol because of its lower cost,lower viscosity,and lower solubility in liquid hydrocarbons."}
{"text": "To be effective,the inhibitor must be present at the very point where the wet gas is cooled to its hydrate temperature. For example,in refrigeration plants glycol inhibitors are typically sprayed on the tube-sheet faces of the gas exchang- ers so that they can flow with the gas through the tubes.As water condenses,inhibitors are present to mix with the water and prevent hydrates."}

{"text": "Liquid desiccant dehydration equipment is simple to operate and maintain.It can easily be automated for unat- tended operation,for example,glycol dehydration at a remote production well.Liquid desiccants can be used for sour gases,but additional precautions in the design are needed due to the solubility of the acid gases in the desiccant solution."}
{"text": "Solid desiccants are normally used for extremely low dew point specifications as required for expander plants to recover liquid hydrocarbons."}
{"text": "The more common liquids in use for dehydrating natural gas are triethylene glycol(TEG),diethylene glycol(DEG), and tetraethylene glycol(TREG).In general,glycols are used for applications where dew point depressions of the order of 15 to 50℃ (59 to 120°F)are required.TEG is the most commonly used glycol."}

{"text": "The wet-rich glycol that has now absorbed the water vapor from the gas stream leaves the bottom of the glycol- gas contactor column and passes through a high-pressure glycol filter.The high-pressure glycol filter will remove any foreign solid particles that may have been picked up from the gas stream in the contactor before the glycol enters the power side of the glycol pump.This is generally considered to be the ideal location for primary filtration of the glycol stream."}
{"text": "From the glycol filter,water-rich glycol flows through the condenser coil,flashes off gas in the flash tank,and flows through the glycol-glycol heat exchanger to the regenerator portion of the unit.The warmed water-rich glycol enters the lower part of the stripping stillcolumn that is packed with ceramic saddles and is insulated.An atmospheric reflux condenser is integral with the stripping stillat the top of the still,plus some water vapor to provide the adequate reflux required for the stripping column.This reflux condenser is also packed with ceramic saddles to assure that all the vapor to be vented will come in contact with the cool wall of the condenser."}
{"text": "The wet glycol,after entering the stripping still col- umn will flow downward toward the reboiler contacting hot rising glycol vapors,water vapors,and stripping gas. The water vapor has a lower boiling point than glycol; therefore,any rising glycol vapors will be condensed in the stripping still and be returned to the reboiler section.In the reboiler,the glycol must travel a substantially horizontal path along the firebox to reach the liquid overflow exit at the opposite end.Here in the reboiler the glycol is heated to between 175℃ and 200℃ to remove enough water vapor to reconcentrate it to 99.5%or more.For extra dry glycol (99%plus),it may be necessary to add some stripping gas to the reboiler."}

{"text": "The static pressure may be taken from either the upstream or downstream pressure;however,in certain instances the use of pressure between the upstream and downstream pressure simplifies the calculations.When intermediate pressure connections are used,the recorded static pressure is less than the upstream pressure and greater than the downstream pressure."}
{"text": "If the line pressure is less than atmospheric pressure,the absolute pressure of the gas in the line in psia is equal to the atmospheric pressure in psia minus the gage pressure in psig.If the gage pressure is 4.0 psia(below atmospheric pressure)and the atmospheric pressure is 14.4 psia,the absolute pressure,pf,of the gas in the line is 10.4 psia\n\nIt is quite common to measure pressures below atmo- spheric pressure with gages calibrated in inches of mercury \"vacuum.\"In such cases it is necessary to convert the \"vacuum\"from inches of mercury into pounds per square inch by multiplying by the conversion factor 0.491;for example,10 in.of mercury“vacuum”=4.91 psig(10× 0.491)below the absolute pressure of the atmosphere."}
{"text": "Pressure Base—The pressure base is the pressure at which the cubic foot is the unit of measurement according to the contract.The basic orifice flow factors referred to in this handbook were calculated for a pressure base of 14.73 psia.If measurement at any other pressure is desired, then correction must be made for the effect of the change to that base.Frequently base pressures are indicated as gage pressures—as a certain number of \"ounces.\"Such an indication would,of course,be above an assumed average atmospheric pressure.In order to definitely specify the basis for the measurement,the base pressure must an absolute pressure.For example,a pressure base of four ounces (above an assumed atmospheric pressure of 14.4 psia)may be written as 14.65 psia.Likewise,a pressure base of eight ounces (above the assumed average atmospheric pressure of 14.7 psia),may be expressed at 15.2 psia.The use of the absolute value is definite and leaves no doubt as to the value of the absolute pressure base.The use of any expression of an actual or an assumed value of the atmospheric pressure is eliminated."}

If the reading of the Fahrenheit thermometer is 60°,the corresponding absolute temperature is 60°added to 460° or 520°F absolute.If the reading is -20°F,the absolute temperature is-20°F+460°or 440F absolute."}

{"text": "Specific Gravity—The specific gravity of a gas is the weight of a cubic foot of gas compared to the weight of a cubic foot of dry air under the same pressure and temperature conditions.If the specific gravity of a gas is 2.0,it's twice as heavy as air,or if the specific gravity of a gas is 0.6,it is six-tenths as heavy as air."}
{"text": "Discharge Coefficient—The discharge coefficient is the ratio of the average velocity through the orifice divided by the theoretical velocity through the orifice.The theoretical velocity is the velocity each particle would assume if it fell through a height equal to the drop in pressure between the taps expressed in feet of fluid of the same density at the flowing fluid.The term\"fluid\"applies to a gas or liquid."}

{"text": "possible deviation from the specification that the upstream edge of the orifice plate be square and sharp.A slight, almost imperceptible,rounding of the orifice edge can produce a considerable increase in the discharge coefficient, which results in low measurement.This is especially true with the smaller orifices in the smaller line sizes,since the effect of the edge imperfection is relative.A wire-edge burr, or fin,on the orifice edge is also undesirable since it can alter the flow pattern of the stream from that corresponding to proper measurement."}
{"text": "Pulsation—The effect of pressure and velocity pulsa- tion's in the vicinity of the orifice constitutes a very indefi- nite phase in the measurement of gas with an orifice meter. This pulsation can be of a low frequency form such as might result from reciprocating compressors,undamped pressure regulators,chatting valves,or liquid surging back and forth at low points in the line.It might also be a high frequency pulsation caused by resonance of the pipelines themselves. The effect of the pulsation's of lower frequency probably have the greater effect on the measurement;however,no conclusive information is at present available by which the pulsation error can be completely correlated with pulsation frequency or with wave form and amplitude of those pul- sations.This problem has been recognized;considerable research is underway,and more is contemplated,to deter- mine means of either eliminating the effect of pulsations or determining the degree of error,which the pulsation might produce."}
{"text": "In some instances,the effect of pulsation has been largely reduced by installing restrictions in the line,which produce pressure drops up to 10%of the line pressure.In many cases,resistances,which create much smaller pres- sure drops,have been found satisfactory.In other instances, installing volume tanks,baffles,or dampeners in the line has minimized the effect.When any of these devices are used,they should be installed between the meter tube and the probable source of the pulsation.It has also been found advantageous to decrease the line size,thereby employing orifices with larger diameter ratios and measuring the gas with a higher differential pressure across the orifice plate."}
{"text": "Wet Gas Measurement—The effect of liquid in the gas stream on measurement is a problem that has never been completely solved.Various arrangements of meter tubes,gage line piping,and drip pots have been used in an effort to minimize the hazard resulting from liquid accumulating ahead of the orifice plate at low points in the gage line or in the chambers of the meter manometer.An accumulation of liquid ahead of the orifice plate disturbs the normal flow pattem and alters the discharge coefficients for the orifice,liquid trapped in the gage line distorts the differential pressure and causes the manometer to give an incorrect indication.Bellows-type manometers with gage lines attached to the bottom of the manometer chambers are self-draining and,therefore,eliminate that portion of the error corresponding to liquid,which may find its way into the manometer."}
{"text": "The expansion factor may be based upon a value of the differential ratio obtained from the meter records or estimated from a knowledge of the differentials and the static pressures at the meter.The differential ratio obtained in this manner will probably be sufficiently close to the average operating condition of the meter for the purpose of selecting the proper value of the factor.The variations in the factor corresponding to the variations in the differential ratio above or below the selected value will be compensating over any appreciable length of time."}

{"text": "A wide variety of engineered tools and structures are used in the production side of the oil and gas industry.Pro- duction equipment includes production tubing,production packers,safety valves,tubing hangers,chokes,flow control equipment,valves and wellheads,gas lift equipment,sucker rods and rod pumps,submersible pumps,compressors,flow lines,and pipelines.Each of these products has different engineering requirements that equates to different metals and conditions.These products may also be exposed to a different set of environmental conditions that pose differ- ent corrosion potentials.These metals and their condition exhibit varying susceptibilities to the various potential cor- rosion reactions that are prevalent in the oilfield production environments."}
{"text": "There has been a large volume of information devel- oped over the years on the subject of corrosion problems encountered in production operations.The solutions to these corrosion problems that we have encountered have created a knowledge base from which we can draw to avoid the many pitfalls that potentially await us in operations."}
{"text": "This chapter is structured to provide an introduction to the causes of corrosion in production,the equipment used in production,and the common techniques to mitigate the effects of corrosion."}
{"text": "and the varied constituents and conditions that occur there. The segments of the production operation(or where in the production stream)are defined here as follows:\n\n1.Downhole Segment—from the formation,the produc- tion fluids flow up production tubing;downhole acces- sories may assist with production or control it."}
{"text": "2.Wellhead—the production fluids are directed and con- trolled by valves and associated equipment as they exit the production tubing on the wellhead."}
{"text": "3.Flowlines/Pipelines—with the assistance of storage facilities and compressors,the production fluids are transported to treatment and refining facilities."}
{"text": "Many operational variables will change with location,and temperature is the one of the most significant.The tempera- ture is highest at the formation and cools as it comes out of the earth through the wellhead and into pipelines and flow- lines.An example of a bottom hole temperature of 175℃ (350°F)may cool to about 85℃(185°F)at the wellhead and ultimately to the range of ambient temperatures in the pipelines.Another factor is phase stability because temper- ature and pressure will effect what phases are present.A discussion of the primary corrosion causing environments is presented below with how the environment changes or is affected by where in the production stream it is."}
{"text": "6.8.2.1 Acid Gas Corrosion\n\nIn production operation,corrosion is usually associated with acidity in the bulk or in localized regions.The acidity in the bulk environment is caused by the presence of acid gases that naturally occur in the formation coexisting with petroleum products or as the result of CO₂gas injection. Acid gases,hydrogen sulfide H₂S and CO₂,are the gases that form acids in aqueous environments.As the concen- tration of these gases increases,the amount of acid in the water phase increases.The more acid (lower pH)there is, the greater the corrosion rate.Listed below are some factors that affect the corrosion from these acid gases."}
{"text": "in how they predict the effect of protective corrosion films and the effect of oil wetting on CO₂corrosion,and these two factors account for the most pronounced differences between the various models [3]."}
{"text": "6.8.2.1.4 Oil Phase and Flow Effects\n\nThe other phases present has a large effect as well.The presence of oil is generally a positive effect in that corrosion rates may be reduced or corrosion may be prevented.The corrosion reaction requires an electrolyte to conduct the flow of electrons,oil being nonpolar,is not a conductor. The heavier the oil(more viscous),the greater the protection provided by the oil."}
{"text": "In addition to the presence of a corrosion reaction that is contingent upon a contacting water phase,the charac- teristics of the resultant corrosion products have a role in corrosion kinetics.As discussed previously,the carbon and low alloy steels form iron carbonate films that provide cor- rosion resistance.In flowing conditions,these films could be removed or compromised by hydrodynamic erosion."}
{"text": "6.8.2.1.6 Velocity and Steels\n\nInvestigating the effects of velocity with other variables provides additional clues that we can use.For example,J.R. Vera et al [9]examined the composition of the corrosion products as a function of flow velocity for a variety of low alloy products including API5CT[10]Grades L80 and C90 tubulars.The primary difference between the L80 and the C90 pipe was the chromium content,which was 0.5%for the L80 and 1.0%for the C90,and molybdenum content, which not present in the L80 and was 0.5%in the C90.The L80 had corrosion rates that increased with velocity up until about 4 m/s and then decreased with increasing velocity. It was found that the C90 had much lower corrosion rates at low velocities but exhibited piting corrosion and an increasing corrosion rate at higher velocities."}
{"text": "Some of the models previously noted that predict CO₂ corrosion take into account the presence of small amounts of H₂S.The potential problem is that,although the H₂S contributes to increasing surface passivity,thereby lowering general corrosion rates,the H₂S increases the tendency toward localized pitting corrosion.The presence of chlo- rides increases this tendency."}
{"text": "6.8.2.2 Environmental Cracking\n\nThere are three types of environmental cracking that occurs in oil and gas production environments that is discussed here.First,there is cracking that is a result of hydrogen adsorption,resulting in embrittlement or cracking.Second, there is stress corrosion cracking where the cracking agent is chloride but the mechanism is assisted when H₂S is also present.Third,there is sulfide stress cracking(SSC),and this a cracking phenomenon that is related both to internal hydrogen effects and stress corrosion cracking."}
{"text": "The stress corrosion cracking and SSC mechanisms requires a susceptible material that is exposed to an envi- ronment that causes stress corrosion cracking of the specific material under the application of a tensile stress.The tensile stress may be imposed,tensile component of an imposed shear stress or residual stress.There is at least one set of environmental conditions in which most metals can exhibit stress corrosion cracking.The hydrogen embrittle- ment (result in hydrogen induced cracking)requires only a hydrogen producing corrosion reaction and a material that is susceptible to cracking."}
{"text": "6.8.2.2.1 H₂S-Sulfide Stress Cracking\n\nSulfide stress corrosion cracking,also known as SSC,is a stress corrosion cracking phenomena that occurs in the presence of H₂S.H₂S is known to cause or assist in the mechanism of cracking with many alloy types,includ- ing low carbon steels,low alloy steels,alloy steels,tool steels,martensitic stainless steels,ferritic stainless steels, austenitic stainless steels,duplex stainless steels,nickel- copper alloys,and nickel base alloys.For many of these materials,there coexists the potential for chloride stress corrosion cracking.The presence of hydrogen sulfide often increases the severity of the cracking or enlarges the range of environmental conditions where cracking occurs."}
{"text": "Generally,cracking becomes more prevalent or severe when the acidity,water content,chloride content,and H₂S content increases.The severity of the SSC generally lessens as temperature increases;however,increasing temperature could activate a potential SCC mechanism.These compet- ing mechanisms make it difficult to determine which crack- ing mechanism will dominate.The complexity also makes selection of materials and estimating the environmental conditions that render them most susceptible to cracking difficult."}
{"text": "For example,martensitic stainless steels such as 13% chromium are not very susceptible to chloride stress cor- rosion cracking but are susceptible to SSC.The 13% chromium stainless steels would be expected to exhibit a maximum cracking susceptibility at temperatures closer to room temperature."}
{"text": "Austenitic stainless steels,such as the 18%chromium 8%nickel varieties,are primarily susceptible to chloride stress corrosion cracking.For these materials,the potential for cracking steadily increases with increasing temperature and chloride contents.The incidence rates of SCC greatly increase with increasing H₂S levels.The presence of oxygen has dramatic effects on cracking even at low levels."}
{"text": "In duplex stainless steels,where there are both ferritic and austenitic microstructural phases present,susceptibility to both chloride stress corrosion cracking and SSC exists. Because both susceptibilities exist,the temperature of max- imum susceptibility would be expected to be some interme- diate range.Barteri[14]conducted tests and demonstrated that the cracking susceptibility was greatest in the 70℃ to 110C range(160°F to 230°F range)."}
{"text": "environment.In situations in which more corrosion cracking-resistant materials are used,cracking and failures could be delayed to many months with some material environmental combinations."}
{"text": "6.8.2.2.2 Stress Corrosion Cracking\n\nAs discussed in the preceding section,the identification of the mechanism is complicated because there are a variety of processes and conditions that can cause stress corro- sion cracking.For example,we know that stress corrosion cracking can occur as result of either anodic or cathodic corrosion reactions;it is also possible to have both anodic and cathodic reactions promoting stress corrosion cracking simultaneously."}
{"text": "For each alloy and condition under a specific set ofenvi- ronmental conditions,there is a threshold stress intensity below which stress corrosion cracking will not occur.The stress intensity is affected by the bulk-applied stress,stress concentration factors,and residual stresses."}
{"text": "For our purposes in considering environmental cracking in oil and gas production environments,the environmental factors that affect stress corrosion cracking are not signifi- cantly different from those that affect SSC."}
{"text": "In the oil and gas production environments,these crack- ing mechanisms have been experienced in pressure vessels, pipelines,and flowlines.In HIC,failures can occur at applied stress levels that are a fraction of the yield strength. For example,there have been many well-documented [16] failures due to HIC in low-strength pipeline steels in gas transmission lines containing H₂S."}
{"text": "To avoid HIC,clean steels with uniform microstructures have the best resistance to this form of cracking."}
{"text": "6.8.2.2.4 Testing\n\nThere are a variety of standard test methods exist to deter- mine susceptibility to environmental cracking as a function of material and environmental details."}
{"text": "The tests that examine materials susceptibility to HICis based on measuring the amount of diffusible hydrogen or quantifying the cracking that occurs in standard test envi- ronments.The most widely accepted standard test method for measuring susceptibility to HIC is NACE's TM-0284 [20].This test method uses unstressed beams and internal cracks are assessed as a function of crack direction."}
{"text": "A related phenomenon of cracking that occurs that is oriented by applied stress is SOHIC."}
{"text": "The selection of tests is somewhat dependent on spec- imen geometry.For example,thin-walled tubulars can be tested using C-ring and either three-point or four-point bent beam type test specimens.Bars,forgings,castings and thick wall thickness tubulars can be tested by any of the tests described above."}
{"text": "The double cantilever beam (DCB)test results in a fracture toughness constant(Kissc)that is relative to the environment in which the test is conducted.The slow strain rate tests (SSRTs)result in ductility ratios between tests conducted in air versus tests conducted in a test environment ."}
{"text": "In applying these tests for qualification purposes,the selection of tests and the test environment for steels is straight forward.The environments that are most often used are either the standard test conditions defined in NACE TM0177 [21]or a mock-up of the worst case actual produc- tion environment.The stress level required for qualification purposes by NACE/ISO 15156 [12]in the TM0177 type conditions would be at a minimum of 80%of the actual yield strength,whereas the mock-up environments would require a minimum of 90%of the actual yield strength."}
{"text": "Testing of corrosion-resistant alloys varies in that often more than one type test or test environment is required to determine resistance to more than one potential fail- ure mode.For example,many stainless steels are tested for room temperature resistance to SSC and elevated temperature testing for resistance to stress corrosion crack- ing with H₂S."}
{"text": "Note 2:The pH level and buffering to be described."}
{"text": "6.8.2.3 Other Fluids in Production Operations In addition to production fluids,production equipment is often exposed to other fluids.For example,during well completions,weighted salt (brine)environments are fre- quently used.These are often referred to as packer fluids or packer brines.During the life cycle of a producing well,the production from the formation will decrease and production can be stimulated through injection of acids into the formation.Often naturally occurring formation salts will deposit along metals walls,and these may clog or restrict production;these are removed through the use of scale inhibitors or removers."}
{"text": "In addition to production wells,there are also injection wells where CO₂steam of fresh or salt water is injected into the formation to stimulate production.Often the same wells that are used to stimulate are used to produce the hydrocarbons,these will,therefore,alternate between being injectors and producers.Another method used to enhance production it gas lift.In these applications,produced gas is reinjected into the production tubing."}
{"text": "There are several potential problems that stem from these completion brines.First,many of the brines are acidic and therefore are corrosive.The most acidic of the above brines is zinc bromide.An associated problem with zinc bromide is the effect on elastomers,nitrile based elas- tomers are degraded by contact with this brine.Second, the intrusion of production acid gases (CO₂and H₂S)in high-pressure high-temperature(HPHT)gas wells into the brines will acidify it.When the brines become acidified, there is an increased risk of corrosion and stress corrosion cracking.There are many examples of these corrosion [25] and environmental cracking problems [26]."}
{"text": "There continues to be incidences of failures in brines, and there is continuing efforts to use safer weighted brines.For example,there has been recent work reported on mixture of potassium and cesium formates as packer brines [27]."}
{"text": "6.8.2.4 Microbiologically Induced Corrosion Microorganisms are present throughout our environment."}
{"text": "6.8.2.3.3 Injected Gases-Gas Lift and CO₂Flood\n\nProduced gas is used in gas lift operations as a means to enhance production.The injected gas in injected at points downhole in the production string to \"lift\"the fluids.The produced gas may contain acid gases,so the same care is required in lift operations as in the production string."}
{"text": "In CO₂flood operations,the formation is stimulated by injected of CO₂.Because CO₂forms carbonic acid in water, this acidifies the formation.In the producing wells in fields\n\nThese organisms can result in corrosion by producing a deposit on metal surfaces and/or by increasing the acid- ity/reducing the pH of the environment.This altering the environment can occur in the bulk of locally.This type of corrosion can be found in flowlines and pipelines where these microorganisms are inadvertently introduced during inspection and pigging operations."}
{"text": "In addition to the bacteria examples above,there are also molds,yeasts,algae,and protozoa.These,like bacteria, can have either a waste product that enhances corrosion or can result in slimes or deposits beneath which oxygen concentration cells/localized corrosion attack can result."}
{"text": "6.8.3 Production Equipment\n\nThe operations of the various products used in the produc- tion of oil and gas are discussed elsewhere in this handbook. In this section,the different types of completions and the corresponding materials of construction are presented."}
{"text": "For small-diameter wellbores at relatively shallow depths,a tubing-less type of completion can be used.In these instances,the small-diameter casing such as 2-7/8\" is cemented into place and conventionally perforated in the production zone.The casing then becomes the tubing string."}
{"text": "The advantage of this type of completion is that it provides a low-cost completion technique."}
{"text": "The various components and functions of the production equipment illustrated in the preceding schematics are dis- cussed elsewhere in this handbook.The following sections describe the typical variety of metallic materials that are used in the construction so that an understanding of the potential corrosion problems can be obtained."}
{"text": "6.8.3.1 Production Tubing and Casing\n\nIn normal operations,the casing is protected from the production fluids.The corrosion risk for casing lies when the casing is used for production or when formation fluids migrate through the barriers that are used such as packers and cement."}
{"text": "The tubing is the conduit through which petroleum products are removed from the wells.The tubing is one of the largest investments made by operators during the com- pletion phase of oilfield operations.The tubing is therefore the single largest investment that is subjected directly to corrosive production environments and requires evaluation of potential corrosion and cracking reactions."}
{"text": "The L80 types 9Cr and 13Cr are used extensively in CO₂-containing anaerobic production environments."}
{"text": "6.8.3.2 Packers,Safety Valves,and Other Downhole Accessories\n\nThe downhole accessories such as packers and safety valves are typically made from similar materials to the tubing string.Generally,the materials are selected such that the accessory corrosion resistance is equal to or slightly better than the tubing string.One major difference between the accessories and the tubulars is the form of the raw materials; most accessories are tubular in nature but they are typically machined from bar stock.This translates to a different set of metals being used because of the inability to achieve the required mechanical properties from cold worked tubular corrosion resistant alloys in heavy sections."}
{"text": "6.8.3.3 Wellhead/Valves\n\nThe wellhead valves and assorted hardware have different material constraints than the tubulars and downhole acces- sories previously discussed.The equipment is typically larger because it does not have to fit through the casing.This permits new material options that encompass forgings and castings,and where corrosion resistance is required,linings and overlays can be used."}
{"text": "The gas lift equipment is similar in nature to downhole accessories in that most of the materials used in gas lift equipment can also be found in gas lift.Additionally,there are copper nickel alloys such as alloy 400 and alloys 405 that are found gas lift equipment."}
{"text": "Many of the steel materials above utilize surface hardening techniques such as carburizing,nitriding,induc- tion hardening,arc spray hardsurfacing,high-velocity oxy- fuel(HVOF)hardsurfacing,electroless nickel plating,and chromium plating."}
{"text": "For the transportation of corrosive production fluids in flowlines and pipelines,there have been numerous applica- tions of clad pipe and corrosion resistant alloy pipe.The intermal cladding has been a variety of austenitic and duplex stainless steels and nickel-based alloys."}
{"text": "Because of the welding requirements for the pipe products,most of the corrosion-resistant alloys used for pipe have been 22%to 25%chromium duplex stainless steels."}
{"text": "6.8.4 Mitigation Techniques\n\nTo combat corrosion,an understanding of why it occurs and knowledge of the environment is necessary.The next step is to understand the life cycle requirements of the equipment and how the operations and environments may change over the life of the equipment.Once we know these variables,we proceed to examining the equipment on which we need to control corrosion to determine where corrosion needs to be prevented and the material requirements of the components. Finally,we assess the various techniques available to us so that we can prevent or control corrosion."}
{"text": "The most common methods to control corrosion in the petroleum industry are(1)materials selection for corrosion resistance;(2)chemical inhibition of the corrosion reac- tions;(3)coatings that are either sacrificial,corrosion resis- tant,or barriers to corrosion;(4)cathodic protection;and (5)designing with a corrosion a allowance.In this section the topics of material selection,coatings,and inhibition are presented."}
{"text": "The common materials used for typical production equipment such as production tubing and casing,downhole accessories,wellhead equipment,artificial lift equipment, and pipelines have been discussed previously under this topic of production corrosion.Within that range of mate- rials,some of the basis for materials selection is presented herein."}
{"text": "From the above relationship,the higher the PREN number,the higher the resistance to general corrosion and pitting corrosion.To mitigate the effects of corrosion,we can select alloys that exhibit a high PREN number.For most metals there is a critical temperature below which pitting does not occur.This temperature is dependent on the composition and the specific environment.For stainless steels,the critical pitting temperature is related to the PREN number as expressed above."}
{"text": "Although this evaluation of PREN permits an initial assessment and ranks alloys by alloy content,the PREN is often not sufficient by itself as a guide to select the most economical material for the application.For example,the resistance to environmental cracking and the other property requirements of the equipment are not assessed.The PREN can be used as a tool in conjunction with (1)company experience,(2)field and customer experience,(3)literature searches,(4)industry wide experience and consultants,(5) material testing,and (6)prototype equipment tests."}

{"text": "For 13Cr stainless steels,these constituents can lead to severe corrosion pitting and,in the case of H₂S,could lead to environmental cracking.For 316 stainless steel,both oxygen and H₂S can lead to environmental cracking."}
{"text": "coatings.With all of these classes,the one feature that has a huge role in the final success rate is the surface preparation. The surface needs to be clean and free of contaminants and exhibit the proper surface profile for the specific coating being applied."}
{"text": "The plating metals used most often in the petroleum industry are chromium and nickel.Both of these can be electroplated,and nickel is also available as an electroless plating.Chromium platings are generally very hard and exhibit numerous microcracks that precludes its use as a corrosion barrier.This problem is exasperated by the potential galvanic difference between the chromium and the substrate that can drive the initiation and propagation of localized corrosion attack,ultimately resulting in deep pen- etrating corrosion pits and disbondment of the chormium plating.There are very thin dense chromium platings with a coating thickness less than 0.25 mm(0.001 in.)that can be dense and crack-free.Chromium platings are often plated over thin electroplated nickel,where the nickel provides the corrosion barrier and the hard chromium provides the desired wear resistance."}
{"text": "Inorganic coatings includes include(1)surface con- versions,(2)inorganic zinc silicate,(3)HVOF ceramic coatings,and (4)flame and arc spray ceramic coatings.The common surface conversions are anodizing on aluminum, phosphating and oxidizing processes on steels and chromate surface conversions on steel."}
{"text": "Organic coatings include(1)epoxy paints,(2)acrylic paints,(3)polyurethane paints,(4)organic zinc paints, (5)phenolic coatings,(6)epoxy-phenolic coatings,(7) fluorocarbon based coatings,(8)molybdenum disulfide coatings,and(9)silicone paints and coatings.Generally, where the word \"paint\"appears in the above list,the coating consists of at least two components,one a carrier and one the paint.In many cases,with two or more part products that are mixed,the paint undergoes a chemical reaction, causing or assisting in the curing and/or drying cycles. The coating listed above that do not list paint generally require a heat curing cycle that sets the coating onto the substrate."}
{"text": "Organic internal pipe and tubing coatings definitely pro- vide a benefit by reducing power costs,increasing flow and eliminating corrosion [39].Rehabilitating a pipeline with inplace internal coating versus replacement returns the line to active service.During research of flow improvement due to pipe cleaning,additional studies were made to determine the improvements in pipeline flow and corrosion protection with use of coatings [40].The conclusion was that both flow improvement and corrosion protection were evident."}

{"text": "3.They change the characteristics of the environment either by producing protective particulates or by remov- ing or inactivating an aggressive constituent in the envi-\n\nronments."}
{"text": "The corrosion inhibitors that are used in the petroleum industry are typically organic compounds,and they are usually employed at low concentration levels,generally on the order of 0.1%."}
{"text": "Asa type of material,the inhibitor may be an organic or an inorganic compound.Inorganic inhibitors include chro- mates(CrO₄²),silicates (SiO₃²),and phosphates(PO-²). The three basic types of inorganic inhibitors are anodic passivating inhibitors,cathodic inhibitors,and cathodic pre- cipitators.There are also mixed inhibitors that suppress both anodic and cathodic reactions."}
{"text": "Anodic inhibitors suppress or prevent anodic reactions by assisting the natural passivation of metal surfaces or by forming films/deposits that isolate the metal from the envi- ronment.These anodicinhibitors are sometimes categorized by being either highly oxidizing or much less oxidizing. Examples of the highly oxidizing anions include chromates, nitrites,and nitrates."}
{"text": "dangerous inhibitors because they can actually cause pitting when present in low concentrations.Anodic inhibitors are also considered dangerous because cathodic reaction may not be inhibited on unprotected areas [43]."}
{"text": "The cathodic inhibitors suppress the cathodic chemical reaction,and these are further subgrouped by the way in which the cathodic reaction is affected.The three basic types are cathodic poisons,cathodic precipitators,and oxy- gen scavengers."}
{"text": "The organic type of inhibitors affect the entire surface of the metal by forming films on the surface.The organic inhibitors are semipolar in that the make-up of the inhibitor includes a polar (conductive)and a nonpolar(nonconduc- tive)component.The semipolar nature renders one end of the molecule hydrophobic(water repelling)and the other hydrophilic(water loving)."}
{"text": "One advantage of the organic inhibitors is that they are typically self-healing when the inhibitor is present in sufficient concentration.If the film is damaged or removed through flowing conditions,the film reforms.Examples of organic inhibitors include primary amines,carboxy- lated amines,amides,imidazoline,and quaternary ammo- nium ion."}
{"text": "Water soluble inhibitors are used in systems with a sig- nificant water phase.Examples of water soluble inhibitors include quaternary amines,amine salts and salted imida- zolines.Oil soluble inhibitors include long-chain primary amines,imidazolines,fatty acids,and phosphate esters. These inhibitors can be used in both batch and continuous inhibitor injection systems."}
{"text": "Batch treatments usually rely on oil-soluble or oil-and water-insoluble inhibitors.The reason is that there needs to some insolubility in the water phase if there is a persistent film when water wet.Gas-phase inhibitors are usually low- molecular-weight amines that have high vapor pressures such as some carboxylated amines."}
{"text": "The inhibition systems are classified by the method by which the inhibitors are introduced into the production fluids (continuous,batch,and squeeze)."}
{"text": "6.8.4.3.2 Choosing Inhibition for Wellhead and Downhole Equipment\n\nDuring production operations,failures of tubular goods and equipment are mainly caused by the presence of carbon dioxide,hydrogen sulfide,oxygen,and water.The following general procedures for a new design are recommended."}
{"text": "1.Evaluate the type of corrosion that might occur.In production operations,hydrogen sulfide,carbon dioxide, oxygen,and water are the main causes of corrosion."}
{"text": "2.When H₂S is present,select steels and alloys that are resistant to cracking in the environmental condi- tions present including acidity,phases present,tem- perature and chloride content in addition to the level of H₂S present.While designing the tubular goods and equipment most compatible to the environment encountered,consider the metallurgical factors and alloying elements for \"sweet\"and \"sour\"oil and gas\n\nenvironments."}
{"text": "3.Select the best and most economically feasible inhibitor by considering similar situations and past experience with conditions close to those encountered.In the case of a unique condition,applicable laboratory tests should be performed to confirm the effectiveness of the inhibitor."}
{"text": "4. Determine a method of inhibitor application by con- sidering its effectiveness,economy,and frequency of application."}
{"text": "5.Monitor and inspect the equipment and keep track of the performance to evaluate and update the program\n\ntreatment."}
{"text": "2.Determine the most effective concentration and amount of the inhibitor."}
{"text": "3.Use a practical method to apply the inhibitor to the system.The continuous method,especially with a cap- illary system,is reported to be the most effective and economical."}
{"text": "4.Determine the frequency of application."}
{"text": "5.Monitor and evaluate the performance of the system, and adjust the treatment program according to the observation."}
{"text": "In water flooding not only is corrosion more severe than in primary production,but also there are scale problems. Because water is open to atmosphere,it dissolves more oxygen.Necessary water treatments include:\n\n1.Filtration—to remove the suspended solids from water."}
{"text": "2.Oxygen scavengers—to reduce the oxygen concentration."}
{"text": "3.Scale inhibitors—either to prevent crystallization or prevent the adherence of crystals to the surface.It should be mentioned that improper use of scale causes pseudoscale;therefore,extensive field and laboratory tests should be performed to prevent this problem."}
{"text": "4.Chemical treatment for bacteria—to reduce or elimi- nate the bacteria population."}
{"text": "5.Corrosion inhibition—basically this is the same as primary production.It is more desirable to use inhibitors that reduce scale as well as effective corrosion con-\n\ntrollers."}
{"text": "All three techniques,batch,continuous,and squeeze, have been used for inhibition systems for the protection of downhole equipment.Of the three,the continuous method is the most effective and preferable from a performance perspective.The continuous injection of inhibitor into the fluid stream has been recognized as the optimum treating method since the inception of corrosion control by chemical injection [45-47]."}
{"text": "The batch technique is only used to handle special prob- lems such as the protection of well tubing when downhole injection is difficult.The squeeze technique is used for scale inhibitors but is not typical for corrosion inhibitors because of the potential damage to the formations."}
{"text": "The water injected is natural surface water sources or reinjected produced water.In water flooding not only is corrosion more severe than in primary production,but also there are scale problems.In many instances,the produced water has insufficient volume for injection purposes and additional water is required (naturally occurring surface water).Because water is open to atmosphere,it contains dis- solved oxygen and this contributes greatly to the corrosion potential.Necessary water treatments include:\n\n1.Filtration—to remove the suspended solids from water."}
{"text": "2.Oxygen scavengers—to reduce the oxygen concen- tration."}
{"text": "3.Scale inhibitors—either to prevent crystallization or prevent the adherence of crystals to the surface.The improper use of scale inhibitors causes pseudoscale; therefore,field and laboratory tests should be performed to prevent this problem."}
{"text": "4.Chemical treatment for bacteria—to reduce or elimi- nate the bacteria population."}
{"text": "not completed with sour-service resistant materials,they may need to be abandoned for regulatory,health and safety requirements.Wells completed where hydraulic fracturing or water injection is planned should specify sour-service materials.While this incrementally increases the cost of completions,it is a reasonable cost to mitigate risk for the need of a future shut-in."}
{"text": "The outside of pipelines and flowlines are exposed to ground waters,saltwater,and industrial environments.The lines may be above ground,buried,or submerged beneath fresh or saltwater.Internal corrosion can be controlled by removing one of the active ingredients,water or air,by adding an inhibitor which will make the steel inactive;or using a barrier coating on the steel.A general procedure to mitigate corrosion includes the following:\n\n1.Select coatings and wraps for external pipeline protection."}
{"text": "2.Investigate cathodic protection for buried and sub- merged flowlines and pipelines\n\n3.Reduce sources of oxygen in the fluids transported."}
{"text": "4.Reduce water content and evaluate the use of dehydration."}
{"text": "5.Chemical treatment for bacteria—to reduce or elimi- nate the bacteria population."}
{"text": "6.Evaluate corrosion inhibition and candidate inhibitors."}
{"text": "7.Determine the most effective concentration and amount of the inhibitor."}
{"text": "8.Use a practical method to apply the inhibitor to the sys- tem.Because the continuous method,especially with a capillary system,is reported to be the most effective and economical,this method should be considered strongly if applicable."}
{"text": "9.Determine the frequency of application."}
{"text": "10.Monitor and evaluate the performance of the sys- tem and adjust the treatment program according to the observation.Basically this is the same as primary production.It is more desirable to use inhibitors that reduce scale and are effective corrosion controllers."}
{"text": "Dehydration can be used to control corrosion if the water is kept at low level.This method requires considerable equipment and manpower for maintenance,so the cost is high for control.Free water can be removed in the storage tank by allowing the water to settle out of the product. Free and entrained water can be removed by using water separators and coalescers."}
{"text": "For pipelines and flowlines,the most common method employed today in controlling internal corrosion is the use of organic or oil-soluble inhibitors.These inhibitors are generally hydrocarbons(with polar group attached)that tend to form a protective film on the pipeline's internal sur- face [49].Water-soluble corrosion inhibitors are also used to solve internal pipeline corrosion problems but because of the relatively short film life of water-soluble corrosion inhibitors,they are continuously injected as opposed to the batch-treatment method."}
{"text": "Oil-soluble corrosion inhibitors are widespread in sys- tems handling both oil and water.This type of inhibitor may do a good job protecting small-diameter pipelines because high velocity or turbulent flow prompts mixing of the inhibitor and produced fluids.However,because of reduction in velocity or turbulence,it may not provide the desired protection in large flowlines or pipelines carrying these same fluids."}
{"text": "The oil-soluble inhibitors have the advantage that they may be injected at the refinery during the normal blending operations and will protect the refinery piping,the pipeline, the gasoline station tanks,etc.This advantage is fully real- ized when a company operates its own pipeline and handles its own products.Similarly,common-product pipelines can inject inhibitor at source points only,or can require shippers to supply inhibited products [51]."}
{"text": "Continuous injection consists of adding a constant vol- ume of inhibitor to the product being transported through the pipeline.This method is probably the most desirable and widely used."}
{"text": "Points of injection should be chosen to provide maxi- mum benefit in the pipeline system.Injection on the suction side of pumps takes advantage of pump turbulence to pro- mote mixing of the inhibitor with product.Injection through a tube into the center of the pipeline aids mixing."}
{"text": "Premixing or dilution of the inhibitor can improve han- dling and promote a more rapid phase-contract.Viscous inhibitors can be diluted with compatible hydrocarbon carriers to decrease viscosity,making pumping easier and metering more accurate,especially at low-dosage rates. Premixing water-phase inhibitors with water before injec- tion greatly facilitates phase contact of inhibitor with entrained water."}
{"text": "Although inhibitors may be slugged,injected,or sprayed into a gas stream,they function only to the extent that they are absorbed onto or react with the steel to set up a barrier between it and the aggressive agents [54]."}
{"text": "Natural gas pipelines can be classified as either wet or dehydrated.Most of the internal corrosion problems discussed thus far are characteristic or wet-gas pipelines."}
{"text": "Dehydrated systems are usually characterized by a water vapor content in the gas less than saturation and the sporadic movement of fluids through the system.Without a contact- ing water phase onto the pipe walls,there is a very low potential for corrosion reactions."}
{"text": "To determine whether the concentration,based on gas volume,is sufficient,there are tests for chemical concen- trations in water;these are called residuals.This informa- tion,combined with comprehensive monitoring,allows for maximum protection at minimum cost.It should be realized that residuals can fluctuate widely in systems where water volumes are subject to great fluctuations.These residuals are still very useful when monitored over a period of time and a statistical average determined."}
{"text": "Wide variations in temperature,total pressure and changes in pressure during production make practical control of scale deposition difficult in water-flooding oper- ations.CaSO4(calcium sulfate),CaCO₃(calcium carbon- ate),BaSO₄(barium sulfate),SrSO₄(strontium sulfate), FeCO₃(iron carbonate),and iron hydroxides are the most common scales in oilfield environments.There are a number of reasons for precipitating scale.Temperature,pressure, and water incompatibility are known to be the major causes of scale deposition in oilfield environments.Scales are usually formed in a supersaturation condition;that is, when the solubility product of a deposit-forming material is exceeded,it precipitates.A supersaturated solution is a solution that contains a higher concentration of a particular mineral than the solution can hold under the same set of conditions with its solute in equilibrium.Each scale is deposited under certain conditions that depend on temper- ature,pressure,and mineral content."}
{"text": "There are some scale deposits in oilfield environments that are called pseudoscale,that is,the deposit of a reaction product between two or more human-introduced chemicals, or between a naturally occurring fluid and one or more human-introduced chemicals.For example,most water- soluble corrosion inhibitors have a tendency to establish pseudoscale.Also,scale inhibitors such as phosphonates and polymers react with Ca²+and/or Mg²+ions in oilfield brines,thus forming pseudoscales that look and behave exactly like \"real\"scale [59,60]."}
{"text": "Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(EDTA)and nitrilotri- acetic acid (NTA)are known to be the common solvents for BaSO4.These solvents and some other similar chelating compounds break down in BaSO4 crystals by tying up the Ba²+ions.The dissolved Ba²+ions are masked or chelated. Therefore,they become incorporated into new chemical compounds that are soluble [59]."}
{"text": "Fracturing jobs could increase the scale problem unless scale deposition is effectively prevented.The squeeze treat- ment is known to be the most effective method for applica- tion of scale inhibitors to prevent calcium sulfate deposition. One of the most effective scale inhibitors to prevent CaSO₄ scale is a water solution of imidazolines and methylphos- phonic acids [64]."}
{"text": "function of temperature.Other waters will have similar responses."}
{"text": "The use of scale inhibitors is necessary to prevent (CaCO₃)crystallization and adherence in water-flooding and CO₂-flooding operations.Both organic and inor- ganic scale inhibitors have been found to be effective in preventing CaCO₃scale formation.Most inorganic inhibitors are phosphates such as tetrasodium pyrophos- phate,sodium triphosphate,sodium-calcium phosphae,and sodium-magnesium phosphate.These phosphate inhibitors are normally used in the 5 to 60 ppm range that depends upon watercut,treatment application,and type of scale [71]."}
{"text": "phosphonate materials are the most effective.The majority of experience in actual field environments indicates that the general types of organic materials used as scale inhibitors such as phosphonates,disphosphonates,phosphate esters and polyacrylates in concentration of 10 to 100 ppm, are effective in stopping scale deposition through squeeze treatments."}

{"text": "6.9.4 Waste Management\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute(API)estimated that 149 million barrels of drilling waste,17.9 billion barrels of produced water,and 20.6 million barrels of other asso- ciated wastes were generated in 1995 from exploration and production operations.Once generated,managing these wastes in a manner that protects human health and the environment is essential for limiting operators'legal and financial liabilities,as well as makes good business sense. Operators must also determine if the waste is subject to hazardous waste regulations.At times,this determination is misunderstood and can lead to improper waste management decisions.Prudent waste management decisions,even for nonhazardous wastes,should be based on the inherent nature of the waste.Not all waste options are appropri- ate for every waste.The preferred option for preventing pollution is to avoid generating wastes whenever possible (source reduction).Examples include process modifications to reduce waste volumes and material substitution to reduce toxicity.Understanding the procedures for determining the exempt and nonexempt status of a waste is a valuable tool, especially for operators who choose to develop voluntary waste management plans.When these procedures are used in conjunction with knowledge of the nature of the waste, the operator will be better prepared to develop site-specific waste management plans and to manage E&P wastes in a manner that protects human health and the environment [4]."}
{"text": "Under the RCRA exemption,wastes intrinsically associ- ated with exploration and development of oil and gas do not have to follow Subtitle C regulations for disposal.Under Subtitle C,hazardous wastes must follow strict guidelines for storage,treatment,transportation,and disposal.The cost of handling materials under the Subtitle C scenario may be extensive.Under the exemption,the operator is allowed to dispose of exempt well site waste in a prudent manner and is not obligated to use licensed hazardous waste transporters and licensed treatment,storage,and disposal facilities(TSDF)."}
{"text": "Examples of waste covered by the exemption are drilling fluids,cuttings,completion fluids,and rig wash.Waste materials that typically not covered by the exemption are motor and chain oil wastes,thread cleaning solvents,paint- ing waste,trash,and unused completion fluids."}
{"text": "A waste product,whether exempt or not,should always be recycled if economically possible.Oil-based drilling mud is typically purchased back by the vendor for reuse. Unused chemicals are similarly taken back for resale. Arrangements should be made with the mud company for partial drums or sacks of chemical.Muds also may be used on more than one hole.With the advent of closed-system drilling,the muds be moved off location in the event of a producing well."}
{"text": "If a waste is generated that is a listed or characteris- tic item,the operator must follow certain guidelines [6]."}
{"text": "A listed hazardous waste(e.g.,mercury,benzene)is consid- ered hazardous if the concentrations in which they naturally occur above certain limitations (40 CFR 261.31-261.33). The listed hazardous waste may not be diluted to achieve a lesser concentration and thus become nonhazardous.A characteristic hazardous waste(40 CFR 261.21-261.24) may be diluted to a nonhazardous status."}
{"text": "Most nonexempt,nonacute hazardous waste generated on location is considered a small quantity.In this case,the waste may remain on location for 90 days.At that time,a Department of Transportation (DOT)-licensed motor car- rier must transfer the waste to an EPA-certified TSDF for disposal.Appropriate documentation and packaging must conform to regulations.The operator continues to be liable for the waste as denoted by the cradle-to-grave concept [7]."}
{"text": "Generally,waste that must be produced to complete the work involved in the exploration and production of oil and gas is considered exempt,allowing the operator the option of disposing of the waste in a prudent manner.A nonexempt waste(e.g.,radioactive tracer waste)should be avoided if possible.These wastes must be disposed of according to federal and state regulations.Because these regulations are becoming more complicated with time,the operator should consult the primary regulator in questionable circumstances."}

{"text": "of determining conductivity is analogous to determining relative permeabilities in a reservoir core sample.In the present analysis,a soil core is taken and left in the core barrel with the soil water content undisturbed.The site's liquid hydrocarbon is then introduced over the soil core at a constant representative head.The time to exit the barrel will infer the influx of the hydrocarbon at partial saturation. This time is critical due to fingering of hydrocarbons.The area affected initially may be much less than the total area of the barrel.The test is continued until the sample is saturated.The conductivity is then estimated using Darcy's Law(Equation 6.9.14).The mass flowrate may then be estimated from this conductivity relationship."}
{"text": "The constant K is a measure of the soils'volumetric capacity of hydrocarbon saturation,whereas the constant 1/n is the measure of the mutual attraction between the constituents.Once the isotherm is defined,it may then be used to predict effluent concentrations of hydrocarbons that may be transported into the groundwater."}

{"text": "6.10.4.2 Spars\n\nOwing to relatively lower capital investment requirements, the prospect for reuse as well as the prospect for supporting dry trees,spars have become a relatively popular offshore development concept.Spar hulls are similar to the tension leg platform concept in that they rely on buoyancy to support the facility,and presumably,the associated dry tree systems.Spars differ in that they take advantage of water depth to promote vessel stability,and utilize catenary mooring lines (poly,or wire rope)as opposed to steel tendons,to maintain vessel positioning."}

{"text": "control umbilicals.Early subsea systems were developed with the simple objective of gathering production streams from multiple wells so that they could be produced through a riser or risers to a surface host.The wells had to flow naturally against the backpressure of the seawater column."}
{"text": "Whereas dry tree systems can continue flowing until the wells deplete to near atmospheric pressure,production from subsea wells becomes truncated early owing to the pressure burden of the water column.So to enhance recovery,subsea production boosting systems have been evolving rapidly through field trials beginning in the early 2000s.Boosting systems are categorized broadly as either;(1)full well- stream boosting from the seafloor,(2)subsea gas compres- sion,(3)subsea pumping to boost water injection volumes, or(4)subsea separation and processing."}
{"text": "Early trials with full wellstream boosting generally developed as retrofits to existing subsea systems installa- tions.Pumps were \"bolted onto\"facilities that may or may not have been designed to accept them,and likewise had to be accommodated by host facilities that might or might not have been built with capability for handling the additional umbilical and riser requirements,from either a weight, space,or power generation standpoint (see \"Life Cycle Planning,\"below).Full wellstream boosting also includes the use of electrical submersible pumps,located downhole as part of the tubing string of each well.Principally,how- ever,wellstream boosting occurs as part of a multi-well manifold shared by more than one well."}
{"text": "The key variable in design of full wellstream boosting systems is the percentage of gas in the flowstream,referred to as gas volume factor(GVF).GVF is simply the volu- metric percentage of gas in the flowstream and is a function of reservoir fluid properties as well as ambient pressure in the process stream.GVF will vary dramatically over wells' lifetimes."}

{"text": "6.10.5.1 Planning for Well Intervention\n\nIn addition to providing protection and support to the wells drilled for offshore developments,offshore systems must provide for the need to intervene on,or\"workover\"the wells hosted by the system.In the case of dry trees the process is similar to that which is utilized for land wells.The system must be capable of supporting a rig or service unit (either coiled tubing or wireline)that can access the well, and there must be space for support equipment including quarters for personnel."}
{"text": "For subsea wells,intervention planning has in the past typically required using a rig to partially deconstruct the well for purposes of either repairing or recompleting. Increasingly,industry is utilizing \"Light Well Intervention\" (LWI)methods deployable from a vessel,for accessing subsea wells without removing the subsea Christmas tree."}
{"text": "Effective planning for subsea well intervention includes early decisions about the style,(either horizontal or vertical) of tree [12]."}

{"text": "6.10.7 The Evolution of Regulation and Safe Practice in the Offshore\n\nEvents associated with the blowout of the Gulf of Mexico Macondo well have drawn attention to the issue of Offshore Safety.Offshore safety and pollution prevention have been an abiding concern for industry and regulators beginning with initial developments in 1932.In the United States, operations by oil companies on offshore lands have been subject to rules promulgated by the Department of Interior as the owner of the federal lands,and the US Coast Guard, which is charged with assuring unfettered navigation of waterways.Regulatory responsibilities and interests in other countries follow a similar model,and most countries follow United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,when it comes to oil industry practices that intersect the interests of seaborne navigation,fishing,and other uses including defense and the management of coastal zones."}

{"text": "6.10.8.1 Pollution Prevention\n\nOffshore production facilities must include methods for containment and proper disposal of contaminants (liquids or solids containing liquid hydrocarbons,relatively high concentrations of caustic or acidic chemicals,raw sewage, trash,and inedible garbage).Waste streams including air emissions are typically regulated.In the United States,reg- ulations are promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency."}
{"text": "Guidelines are provided in API RP 75,Recommended practice for development of a safety and environmental management program for offshore operations and facilities [18].Design and operating practices,many of which are prescribed by regulation,are outlined in the 14 series API documents [19-22]."}
{"text": "Practical considerations include:\n\n● All deck areas that have a source of oil leakage,spills, or drips(e.g.,control valves around vessels and tanks) must be surrounded by a curbing or a continuous gutter. Normally,drip or skid pans are installed under equip- ment;liquids are routed to the open drain system.These drain pans serve as primary containment."}
{"text": "● For installations where toilets are installed and human waste is discharged into surrounding waters,the effluent must meet requirements of applicable government agen- cies.Combustible solid wastes,such as paper of wood products,or other organic material,such as garbage may be disposed of by incineration (if permitted)in an approved dual burn chamber incinerator.Alternatively, the waste may be placed in containers and transported to shore for proper disposal."}

{"text": "Weather conditions,such as temperature,precipitation, humidity,and winds,have a significant effect on the over- all arrangement of the production facility structure.For example,in cold climates,enclosed structures are desirable. Enclosures in turn affect design considerations such as ventilation and communication systems."}
{"text": "General information on the various types of storms that might affect the platform site should be used to supplement other data developed for operational conditions.Statistics can be compiled,giving the expected occurrence of storms by the seasons,direction of approach,etc.Of special interest for construction planning is the duration of installation activity.Also of major importance is the ability to forecast storms in the vicinity of a platform."}

{"text": "Helicopter pads should be located so as to give clear landing approaches for the helicopters.Stacks,guy wires, crane booms,antennas,etc.,should be arranged so as not to intrude into the approach or departure paths of the heli- copters.The lack of other structures in the area may dictate the need for landing space for two or more helicopters."}

{"text": "Major equipment items also have an automated blow- down valve to depressurize large gas volumes in the equip- ment in less than 1 to 2 min should an unsafe condition occur (e.g.,fire).The tremendous pressure drops associ- ated with relief valves and blowdown valves can create cryogenic conditions.So material selection for valves and downstream piping is a concern.Another consideration is the instantaneous gas flow rate in a relief or blow- down condition.This rate can exceed the design capacity of the scrubber and flare system if the system is not carefully designed.Additional design considerations for relief systems may be found in GPSA Engineering Data Book [33]."}
{"text": "Larger facilities may have a flare system for discharging gas through a control valve from a pressured system to the atmosphere during normal operations.The flare system normally includes a flare control valve,collection piping, the gas liquid scrubber,and gas flare.This discharge may be either continuous or intermittent.Continuous flaring is not allowed in the Gulf of Mexico and most countries. Produced gas must be processed for gas sales or re-injected. Continuous flaring still occurs in remote areas with no mar- ket for the gas.On some platforms,considerable quantities (e.g.,upward of 300 MMSCFD on a single facility)are flared.However,these countries realize the lost resources are revenues cannot be replaced,and they are moving to eliminate flaring."}
{"text": "Flare systems today normally have a dual flare tip (low pressure and high pressure)to enable quick,simultaneous depressurization of low-and high-pressure production sys- tems.It is important that no air flow back into the flare system piping because it would create a potentially explo- sive mixture.Heat radiation from the flare tip during relief and blowdown is a major concern for not only operating personnel but also nearby equipment."}
{"text": "6.10.8.9 Flare and Emergency Relief Systems\n\nFlare and emergency relief systems associated with process equipment should be designed and located with consider- ation of the amount of combustibles to be relieved,pre- vailing winds,location of other equipment (including rigs, personnel quarters,fresh air intake systems,and helicopter approaches),and other factors affecting the safe,normal flaring or emergency relieving of the process fluids and gases."}

{"text": "The primary objective of oil production is the income to be derived from the sales of the produced oil,not the oil itself.However,potential total income is difficult to compare among properties in any useful manner.Therefore, \"reserves\"is used as an euphemism for the future income and provides a means of keeping track of that future income and of comparing one property or company to another. Reserves are also used as a commonly accepted repository of the value of a property,even though the values is derived from the income resulting form production and sale of the oil that makes up the reserve.Unfortunately,both expected income and the related reserves are transitory,and neither is entirely satisfactory as a measure."}
{"text": "Discovered resources include recoverable and nonrecov- erable resources,where the recoverable resources include cumulative production,if any,to date and reserves.If there has been no production,then all the recoverable resource is classed as reserves.DOE describes discovered recoverable resources as\"...those economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas for which specific locations are known.\"[2] DOE further classifies resources as economically recover- able or economically unrecoverable."}
{"text": "The petroleum industry and related interests have created an elaborate hierarchy of resources and reserves coupled with a more restrictive terminology that includes a significant concern for economics.Although it is not possible in this space to explore all the definitions and terminology,the concept of reserves is vital to petroleum economics and must,of necessity,be thoroughly under- stood.The resources concept is not further discussed."}
{"text": "If reserves are a function of the interaction of a set of expectations for future production and economic conditions, and if those expected conditions are variable in both time and space,then reserves are relative.To avoid a situation in which reserves lose all meaning as a comparative measure, a definition for reserves is necessary in order to provide some broadly accepted constraints on the conditions that would result in the estimation of a particular volume of reserves.Without a definition as a guideline or reference,a volume labeled as \"reserves\"could be anything,but would have no meaning to anyone."}
{"text": "The events of the 1970s and resulting changes in the oil industry led to the issuance of definitions by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)in 1979,by SPE in 1981, and by the World Petroleum Congress(WPC)in 1983. SPE revised its definitions in 1987 and,in cooperation with WPC,again in 1997.Until 1983 all reserves definitions,at least those issued by recognized authorities such as API and SPE,were for proved reserves only.The WPC definitions of 1983 include d categories ranging from proved to “spec- ulative\"reserves.The 1987 SPE definitions were the first to formally define proved,probable.This does not mean that the terms were not in use or that probable and possible reserves had not been calculated and reported.Producing companies,consulting firms,banks,and govenment agen- cies developed their own criteria for unproved reserves and used them."}
{"text": "Regarding the 1987 SPE definition,SPEE wrote:\n\n“The definitions for oil and gas reserves were designed to address many of these problems. Until now,there has been no industry standard for probable and possible reserves.The need to categorize such reserves has long been recognized. The many definitions that have been advanced for prob- able and possible reserves have contributed to the confu- sion of those attempting to use these higher-risk reserves estimates."}
{"text": "If deterministic methods are used,the term reasonable certainty is intended to express a high degree of confidence\n\nthat the quantities will be recovered.Ifprobabilistic methods are used,there should be at least an 90%probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate."}
{"text": "The purpose of including this information in the finan- cial report of a company was ostensibly to provide investors with data with which to compare companies.In that context, the fixed price/cost and the 10%discount rate are appro- priate to providing a relative comparison.It may not be accurate or emulate the real world,and it certainly does not represent market value,but is does allow a reasonably informed investor to compare Company A with Company B,particularly over time."}
{"text": "The SEC reserves definitions have very limited applica- tion and utility and will not be further discussed.However,it is essential to be aware of the differences between the SEC and the SPE definitions."}
{"text": "Natural gas is a fluid also composed of many hydro- carbon compounds,although generally not as complex as crude oil.The primary differences between gases are(1) the heating value(generally the methane content),(2)the nonhydrocarbon gas (N2,O2,H₂S,etc.)content,and (3) the amount of liquid of heavy ends that can be obtained as natural gas liquids(NGLs)."}
{"text": "The economic value of natural gas is directly related to its composition.A gas with no nonhydrocarbons and that is entirely methane and ethane has a high heating value. If it contains propanes and other stripable ends,the value increases.Natural gas enjoys a relatively high economic value because it has a low cost of production.However,it is highly regulated through pipeline and utility controls on transportation and pricing so that it rarely achieves equiv- alent value with crude oil on a $/BTU basis.In addition, because of the ease of transporting gas,there is substantial competition among gas producing regions,which acts as a control on gas prices."}
{"text": "Associated products include (a)NGLs that can include propane,butane,natural gasoline,and virtually any other hydrocarbon that can be stripped from gas;(b)sulfur;(c) nonhydrocarbon gases.The NGLs can have substantial eco- nomic value but require investment in specialized striping plants.Pricing tends to be driven by the local market and can be volatile with demand.Sulfur is a common by- product in many Canadian fields and in some areas of the United States.The economic value tends to fluctuate considerably,and sulfur production may often be more of a nuisance than an economic benefit.Nonhydrocarbon gases such as nitrogen,carbon dioxide,and helium can be economic by-products,but in most cases where this occurs the nonhydrocarbon becomes the primary product and the natural gas is secondary."}
{"text": "The economics of crude oil,natural gas,and associated products can differ significantly depending on market con- ditions."}
{"text": "7.1.3 Methods For Estimating Reserves [9-11]\n\nThe true reserves of a property are known only after pro- duction has ceased and the property has been abandoned. Reserves determination is never more than an estimate. Some estimates are based on more knowledge and analysis than others,but a large part of the estimate is the evaluator's perception of future production and economic conditions. Information is critical and the proper usage of available data is vital."}
{"text": "Steps One and Two can be accomplished separately, but as a practical matter the producible volume and the production mechanism are essentially inseparable.Step Three is interactive with Steps One and Two in the sense that the information gained from the analysis in those steps can lead to a decision about:whether to produce by flowing or pumped production,the development well density,whether to use horizontal or straight-hold wells, when to introduce a method of production stimulation,or when to begin enhanced oil recovery (EOR)operations.A decision on production mechanism may in turn influence the estimation of the producible volume and/or the rate(s)of production."}
{"text": "7.1.3.1 Primary Production in Oil Reservoirs\n\nPrimary production uses the natural reservoir energy of dissolved gas,encroaching water,gravity or other source as the recovery mechanism.There are a number of methods available for reserves estimation,which can be used alone or in concert.The use of the methods depends on the stage of life of the property and the amount and quality of data that are available.These methods can be generally grouped as(1)volumetric,(2)material balance,(3)pro- duction performance.Each method has its attributes and drawbacks."}
{"text": "The volumetric method can be subject to considerable error because(1)it is often used to evaluate a property when little specific data may be available and(2)it requires the estimation of reservoir rock and fluid properties and reservoir volumes from spot measurements ofthe properties that are then applied to the entire reservoir.Porosity and water saturation are obtained from well logs and/or core samples that are measured from a small volume of the reservoir and which under the best circumstances,only approximate the conditions in the reservoir.The areal extent of the reservoir is rarely known until many wells are drilled,while volume is estimated using a zone thickness measured at one or more points in the reservoir.While techniques of core analysis and,especially,electric and other well log measurement and analysis have become very sophisticated,and have been advanced by three- dimensional and other seismic and geophysical methods, the volumetric method remains only a gross estimate of oil-in-place."}
{"text": "Recovery factors can be determined from the perfor- mance of similar reservoirs,from laboratory analysis of cores,or computer simulation of anticipated performance. Unit recovery can also be calculated assuming information if available from reservoir fluids and core analysis."}
{"text": "The material balance [14-16]is a more complex method of estimating producible volume,but has the advan- tage of providing an estimate of recovery over time under certain conditions.The method has several forms and requires both an extensive pressure-volume-temperature (PVT)analysis of reservoir fluids and an accurate pressure history of the reservoir.The latter obviously requires that some production (5%to 10%of ultimate recovery)occur before the method can be used.The method is not a substitute for the volumetric method but can be used along with the volumetric method later in the life of the property and is often used to obtain a recovery factor for volumetric calculations.The material balance method could also be used if reliable pressure history data can be obtained for a reservoir with similar rock and fluid properties."}
{"text": "to computer analysis,thereby reducing the tedium of the calculation.The results are converted into recovery per acre foot by:\n\n7.1.3.2 Non-Associated Gas Reservoirs [27,28] The estimation of producible volumes for gas reservoirs is less complex than for oil reservoirs,if only because the fluid dynamics are simpler and similar field performance is more directly applicable.The basic principles of volumetric gas- in-place and recovery factor are the same as for crude oil."}
{"text": "7.1.4.1.1 Economic Limit\n\nIn addition to the requirement for a uniform trend,estima- tion of reserves from production performance requires an end point.This can be an imposed limit,such as the flowrate at a certain wellhead pressure for gas wells,but is most commonly an economic limit."}
{"text": "The economic limit is the production rate at which the revenue from sale of production equals the cost of production at the same time.Continued production at or below the economic limit rate creates no economic gain and would serve no economic purpose.Of course,there may be other reasons to continue production—as many operators did after the price declines of 1986-1990—but the estimated amount of that production is not,by definition, reserves."}
{"text": "In Section 7.4 the expected economic life for a potential drilling investment project is defined as the expected year when the present value of cash inflows (e.g.,revenues)is exceeded by the present value of cash flows(e.g.,costs)."}
{"text": "7.1.4.2 Production Rate-Cumulative Production\n\nA plot of exponential production rate versus cumulative production on cartesian scale often yields a straight line. Extrapolation of this line to the economic limit production rate yields the ultimate oil or gas recovery (under the assumed economic conditions)."}
{"text": "7.1.4.4 Gas-Oil Ratio(GOR)-Cumulative Oil Production\n\nUse of a rate-cum or WOR-cum analysis can be used along with a material balance calculation to estimate periodic and ultimate GOR,which can then be converted to gas production.Conversely,if gas volume is a limitation on production(such as where gas cannot be sold)requiring that gas production be restricted,then GOR versus cumulative oil can be used to estimate recovery."}
{"text": "Analysis of production rate-cum and other variations using hyperbolic or harmonic decline trends may require semi-log or log-log treatment."}
{"text": "In the instance where the property being evaluated does not have sufficient history to be fully definitive,the performance of similar properties may be used to estimate producible volumes for the subject property.The similar property may be another well on the same lease if the subject property is a new well,or it may be a group of wells on an adjacent lease,or even a group of wells in a nearby field that produces from the same reservoir. “Similar”is a broad term and must be used with care. Similar does not necessarily mean identical—no two wells or fields are identical.The properties must,however,share the reservoir rock and fluid characteristics and operating conditions that would allow the evaluator to expect that they would perform much the same way over time.Wells in the same field (or portions thereof)and reservoir should perform in a similar manner,whereas wells in different reservoirs may perform very differently.In some cases, however,even wells in the same reservoir may perform differently if the conditions are changed.Analysis and comparison of the performance of a field or lease developed in the 1950s,for example,may not be relevant to a property developed with more modern methods in the late 1990s.The performance of infill wells may be very different from the original wells if the infill wells reduce the drainage areas of all wells."}
{"text": "Single-well comparisons require extreme care,but can be used by imposing the historical performance decline of one well on a new well.Multiwell or \"family\"curves combine the performance of several wells by overlaying the decline curve of each well and defining a composite curve through the set.The steps to this are:\n\n1.Select the comparable wells or leases."}
{"text": "2.Plot the decline curves for each well or lease with initial production points set at(a)a common zero point of the wells that went on production at near the same time or\n\n(b)at date of first production.Some judgment is needed here."}
{"text": "3.Define a composite decline curve through the curve set."}
{"text": "4.Use the family curve to project the new well or lease."}
{"text": "For primary reserves estimation,the production per- formance method is the most reliable method assuming the data are available and are properly analyzed.The characteristics of the various methods allow them to be used in progression from volumetric to performance with increasing accuracy and reliability.In practice,the methods can be shown to be complementary over time so that one method may be used as a check on another method,all other things being equal."}
{"text": "7.1.4.5.1 ANote on Production Data\n\nUse of the production performance methods of evaluation, either alone or in combination with other methods,requires the collection and analysis of historical production data to formulate a trend that can be extrapolated into the future in the form of a production schedule.There are numerous sources of data,including,but not limited to,company production records,sales records,well tests,reports to regulatory agencies and public data gathering and reporting firms.All data,regardless of the source,must be carefully reviewed for accuracy andto define any variations that may have occurred."}
{"text": "The most common variations in performance are those caused by (a)short producing periods,(b)mechani- cal changes,(c)regulatory restrictions,and(d)capacity restrictions."}
{"text": "Cyclic steaming [37-40]is a common method in oil fields where the oil is high viscosity or has a physical composition that causes production to occur at low rates Steam is injected into a producing well for periods of up to several days.The well is then returned to production after a period of time.The steam is used to transfer heat to the reservoir where the heat serves two primary purposes in varying degrees.Heat reduces the viscosity of the oil. It also \"cleans up\"the wellbore by steam cleaning the perforations and/or liner slots and the sand face of accumu- lated tar and sand thereby improving permeability near the wellbore."}
{"text": "The combination of effects may cause production to increase as much as 10 to 20 times the presteam rate. Wells that have been steamed generally increase to a peak immediately following the steaming and then decline in a definable manner over time.The production cycle may last from a few months to as much as 2 years.Wells can be steamed repeatedly,but the stimulation effect will noticeably diminish with repeated cycles as reservoir energy in the near wellbore region depletes.Eventually,the pro- duction declines to a point where the cost of steaming is equal to the incremental return and cycling steaming is stopped."}
{"text": "In virtually all EOR methods,a fluid is injected into the reservoir at one point with the intention of sweeping or flushing oil from that point to other points in the reservoir where the oil can be produced.For analysis purposes,this is most often pictured as a piston-type mechanism where the injected fluid occupies an increasingly larger part of the reservoir pushing a \"bank\"of oil ahead of it to producing wells."}
{"text": "Regardless of the EOR method used,the project must be designed to consider and account for both mobility and sweep efficiency.Most of the variations in the basic methods result from attempts to alter and improve mobility or sweep efficiency or both."}
{"text": "Gas Injection\n\nThe injection of natural gas either as a pressure maintenance or EOR method is by far the oldest form ofinjection method for increasing oil recovery.Before the time when natural gas became a major fuel source and could be transported,most produced gas was either burned off or injected into the same or another reservoir.Gas injection is virtually unknown in the United States today."}
{"text": "Gas can be a very efficient injection medium but is generally limited (by mobility ratio)to light oil reservoirs with thin sand sections.The method is most efficient when injection can occur in the top of a structure or into an existing gas cap where it then performs as a piston moving downward,pushing oil down or out to producing wells."}
{"text": "Water Injection\n\nWater injection or waterflooding has been around for a long time.Waterflooding may be done by reinjecting produced water from the reservoir;injecting water from other reser- voirs;or by mixing produced waters from various sources."}
{"text": "The Stiles [49]method takes a frontal advance approach but assumes the zone is composed of layers of constant thickness but each layer may have a different permeability. Stiles requires a constant qi and predetermined S 。after flooding.The method extends the frontal advance approach to determine ultimate recoverable oil and then uses fw to determine the recovered fraction as a function of time.The method allows a direct derivation of qo,cumulative oil and WOR."}
{"text": "Suder and Calhoun presented another frontal advance method that allows calculation of injection rates and assumes radial flow up to a point.The method requires a predetermined value for Sor."}
{"text": "Heat Injection Methods\n\n[52]The primary purpose of heat injection using steam or hot water is to transfer heat from the injected fluid to the crude oil and reservoir rocks to reduce oil viscosity Reduction of viscosity in the oil—at least at the water- oil contact—results in an improved mobility ratio,thereby allowing high viscosity oils to be recovered."}
{"text": "Steam is particularly useful for this purpose because steam can carry a much greater quantity of heat per unit volume than can hot water or heated gasses."}
{"text": "Although some attempts to use superheated steam have occurred,in practice steam at about 80%quality (80% vapor/20%liquid)is most commonly used.Heat injection is a costly process due to the requirement to burn fuel to generate steam or hot water.The major limitation on heat injection methods is heat loss in surface facilities,distribu- tion lines,wellbores,and in the reservoir,to over and under- lying rocks and to water in the reservoir.Because of the heat losses in the wellbore,steam injection is normally limited to 3,000 ft.or less in depth.Reservoir heat losses cause the injected fluid to continually cool as the steam front advances from the injection sand face.Continual steam injection is required to attempt to maintain a heated oil-water interface at the flow front.Many authors have described and quanti- fied the heat losses in surface,wellbore and reservoir rocks and reference should be made to those sources."}
{"text": "Marx and Langenheim [53]have presented a series of equations designed to determine the radial distance at which the heat loss ratio in the reservoir equals the heat injection rate."}
{"text": "The inclusion of cost factors ($h and $0)allows the calculation to be thought of as an economic limit as well as a physical limit.The calculation assumes no breakthrough but otherwise could be used to define well spacing for a continuing flood."}
{"text": "One author has proposed methods of determining steam drive performance that envisions a series of displacements occurring.A cold water-oil displacement front;a hot water and condensate oil front;and a steam-condensate and hot water displacement which is partially miscible."}
{"text": "Given the complexity of these calculations and the many variations presented by authors,the evaluator is well advised to make maximum use of data from heat injection projects in similar fields to determine reservoir and produc- tion performance over time.Data on many EOR projects have been published in the 1970s and 1980s as the result of DOE projects and a high level of interest in industry."}

{"text": "Price risk exists because there are price levels at which drilling projects will not be good investments.The issue, of course,is that prices change over time.A large capital commitment made at a time of high prices may become a financial burden if prices drop and stay low for some time. On the other hand,investing at a time of relatively depressed prices will lower development costs and may turn out to be a very good investment if prices increase over the life of the project,especially in the early years."}
{"text": "These intuitive(also called informal)methods are used because of the difficulties in developing statistically based models for factors that might be very difficult to quantify. The other main reason for use of informal methods is the inherent uncertainty associated with long-term forecasts of any variable using any method.If a variable—such as the future price of WTI crude—is subject to multiple complex and difficult-to-predict forces,informal methods may be the only viable alternative for price forecasting."}
{"text": "Simulation is an alternative valuation method that will allow for explicit consideration of price risk in evaluation of drilling alternatives (including the alternative of not drilling).A good capital-investment simulation model will result in outputs that will explicitly include capital invest- ment risk based on changing prices over time.Obviously, the quality of the price model will be a major factor influ- encing the utility of the simulation approach,and numerical simulations cannot be carried out without a mathematical model of some type."}
{"text": "This section of the chapter is directed toward issues impacting both short term(generally,a time horizon of less than 1 year)and longer term(generally,a time horizon of longer than 1 year).For many drilling projects,the projected time horizon can be decades in length at the time of evalu- ation,meaning that some type of price-forecasting model that considers long-term price risk must be implemented."}
{"text": "There are many statistical and/or analytical ways of doing price forecasting.Economists and financial researchers have long delved into details regarding supply and demand,short and long-term impacts on prices,and the appropriate statistical models to use in forecasting demand [3].As noted above,there are also multiple entities using informal methods.There are pros and cons to any approach, and these are summarized in [4].We also use the same definition of\"informal\"methods as the author in [4]in this discussion."}
{"text": "An alternative is forecasting based on a more informal consideration of individual factors (see below)that may influence oil prices in the future.It is likely that factors considered in this process will be factors known to decision makers at the time the forecasting exercise takes place. Future,currently unknown factors—or factors with very low probabilities of occurrence—are difficult to incorporate into factor-based price forecasts."}
{"text": "As an alternative to the difficulties in development of useful price forecasts,many practitioners use constant prices,or point estimates for all future prices,in their evaluation models.We do not support or advocate for this method.We do present an alternative methodology based around sequences of future factor scenarios,and as a starting point sequences of different point estimates may be generated as a first step in this process."}
{"text": "Each of these is an example of a factor that is difficult to quantify and therefore difficult to model in a time-series or other econometric fashion.The factors are important,and are modeled using informal methods.Further,some (such as the financial situation in Greece)are less important by themselves than they are important for their impacts on the global economy-in this case,on the exchange rate of the euro and on the global banking system."}
{"text": "A general list of factors impacting oil prices (and, possibly,energy prices in general)in the short and long term is below."}
{"text": "7.2.2.1 Shorter Term Factors\n\nShort-term factors are variables that may impact the oil price of oil in a timeframe of 1 year or less.Whether any of these should be formally considered in a price forecast is up to the modeler;at a minimum some of these factors should be considered in an informal approach."}
{"text": "Volatility—volatility,possibly influenced by increasing levels of price speculation [6-9],is always present in commodity prices.Unusual levels of volatility,as measured by the variance or standard deviation of prices and/or price changes,can have a negative impact on project evaluation because the possibility of sequences of low prices early in a project increases as volatility increases.Volatility can be formally considered in a price model because standard deviation/variance should be considered as a parameter and/or an error term in any reasonable financial model."}
{"text": "Production Controls and Unconventional Resource Development—OPEC was noteworthy because of recent production increases,particularly by Saudi Arabia,in 2014.World supply has also continued to be greatly impacted by continued development of shale-based resources in the United States.Shale production is a numerical value that by itself can be forecasted,and statistical relationships between production levels and price can be used in forecasting prices based on shale oil production forecasts.Forecasting production controls, and their impact on short-term future prices,is more difficult,though this factor may be a major source of price risk during the critical early years of a development project."}
{"text": "Consumer and Investor Perceptions—these factors can have short-term impacts on prices,though they are difficult to incorporate into a price forecast.The degree to which consumers see climate change as a man-made problem willhave obvious short-and long-term impacts on demand for both energy and policies influencing energy consumption."}
{"text": "7.2.2.2 Longer Term\n\nGeopolitics—probably the hardest factor to formally model,this is also a factor that will always be impactful on energy prices and oil prices in particular.A very com- plex topic,most organizations who attempt to consider geopolitics in oil price forecasts do so in an informal, perhaps scenario-based,manner."}
{"text": "US Supply—the future of US supply,as briefly men- tioned above,is a key driver of both short and longer- term price risk.While analytical models may be appro- priate for contributions to short-term price forecasts, longer-term forecasts formally incorporating US supply will be difficult to implement."}
{"text": "US and Worldwide Demand—this is the ultimate result of worldwide and US economic growth as well as consumer behavioral patterns.Many datasets and data sources exist for US and global demand,and inclusion of this factor in an econometric price forecast(where demand is forecast and then its impact on prices is also forecast using mathematical techniques)is somewhat straightforward.However,forecasts based on analytical models are all subject to increasing predictive uncer- tainty with time."}
{"text": "Efficiencies and Alternative Energy Sources—energy efficiency via use reductions,renewables,and other methods is a well-understood concept among consumers worldwide.Technology is drivingincreasing efficiencies in existing and alternative energy sources,particularly with respect to power but also with regard to transporta- tion.This is another complex set of factors that is diffi- cult to forecast formally,but that should be considered (informally)in any price forecast for projects lasting longer than 10 years."}
{"text": "Regardless of the factor(s)considered in oil price forecast- ing,the facts that fast,nearly instant information dispersion characterizes most financial and commodity markets and the interconnectivity of energy and financial markets means that forecasting becomes a challenging task [9].The best course of action,especially for forecasts longer than 1 year in duration,is likely to be an informal combination of data from quantitative models and qualitative assessments of critical variables."}
{"text": "general forecasted direction(up)is the same,but forecast average prices are not consistent across all three agencies. Some of this,such as the relative enthusiasm of the DB forecasts,may be explained by the timing of the forecast. However,the EIU and IMF forecasts are contemporaneous, indicating that even the presence of experts is no guarantee of consensus or consistency across forecasted time."}
{"text": "It may be possible to explain differences in forecasts according to weights on different factors.For example,fore- casts emphasizing technological advances and conservation will be pessimistic with regard to long-term price trends [10].On the other hand,forecasts placing more weight on factors such as Asian demand,particularly from China and India,will be optimistic with regard to long-term price trends,and will feature increasing prices over the period of the forecast."}
{"text": "where a denotes the regression estimate for a,etc.and oe is the standard error computed as a result of the regression results."}
{"text": "The size of the forecast window is a modeling decision variable.Regardless of the window size,as long as the win- dow size is smaller than the total number of observations, the process consists of running the regressions(in this case, the model in Equation 7.2.2)on the data contained in the window.The â and b estimates are checked for statistical significance—the confidence levels for each are specified by the modeler—and significant parameters are then used to estimate the model parameters in Equation 7.2.1."}
{"text": "The window is then shifted by one data point—so that the first one is omitted and the next one in the data sample is included—and the process is repeated.Once complete,each set of significant parameters³is identified as a scenario.Some scenarios are very short-lived,as their predecessor and successor scenarios may occur in the preceding/succeeding window.Others are longer-lived."}
{"text": "Data for each scenario are recorded and may be used to generate forecasts themselves,or may be used to provide insights into parameter ranges for informal forecasts.It is important to note that,even in informal forecasts using this method,the source for data and insights into development of the parameter sets for the forecasts is the original rolling- window regressions."}
{"text": "The first key parameter is the length of the modeling window—the number of price observations that willbe used to develop parameter models.The second and third are con- fidence levels required for significant parameter estimates for the intercept and slope parameters.These parameter selections will greatly impact the resulting scenarios."}
{"text": "Note the overall quarterly and daily price pattens are similar.This heuristic observation lends some credibility to using quarterly,instead of daily,price forecasts for the drilling capital budgeting decision process."}
{"text": "3.It is also possible to consider only significant values for b in the presence of non-significant intercept estimates.In this case,â=0 which means that F=0."}
{"text": "4.The spot price is the price paid at the curent time and date for a barel ofWTI crude.While this amount will vary across locales and time of day,the generally recognized measurement for WTI spot is the price at Cushing,Oklahoma at 4 pm on the day in question."}
{"text": "4.For a formal model,develop model parameters. Expert opinion about key factors,especially over the longer term,may be used to help select among competing parameter sets—hence the formal/informal approach."}
{"text": "The optimal forecast [12],the non-varying curve is the forecast with no uncertainty.This forecast should be at the center of all forecasts that incorporate uncertainty.The change in scenario can be seen in the optimal forecast.It is important to note that the optimal forecast provides a baseline;one should never use the optimal forecast in a drilling project financial analysis unless one was sure that the forecasted prices would be the actual future prices."}
{"text": "However,a statistical model such as the one presented here can be useful,and if there is sufficient variability in the σdz term then using statistical models in Net Present Value simulations—provided the cash-flow model is a reasonable representation of the problem at hand with regard to the reservoir model,cost models,depreciation,taxes,and other factors—is a reasonable course of action in evaluating risky drilling prospects."}

{"text": "This section has been concerned with a general dis- cussion of oil price forecasting issues and the need for a combination of formal and informal tools and processes to create long-term forecasts that are necessary for evaluation of drilling projects—as well as just about any development process in the energy sector."}

{"text": "The focus of this section is identification of and alter- native techniques for modeling of key risks.A key risk is a variable that can have significant impact on retun on investment(ROD and/or other objective measures.Once a risk has been identified,it may be necessary to model and formally consider a risk before determining whether it is key and therefore should be included in the overall decision risk model.A successful modeling process will result in a decision-situation model that includes all appropriate alternatives and key risks.Such a model is considered to be a requisite model."}
{"text": "The degree to which a model is valid and is a req- uisite model will depend on the quality of the decision and risk-modeling process.Participation by subject-matter experts,decision-makers (if different from the subject- matter experts),and other important personnel within the firm is critical if the modeling process is to succeed.Once the team is assembled and alternatives and risk factors are identified,there are established techniques and method- ologies available for risk analyses,and some of these are introduced in this chapter."}
{"text": "It is up to the firm to designate the individual or team to be responsible for developing a decision model for decisions involving major financial commitments.The designated individual(s)must take care to ensure that the risk analysis process results in a well-developed,valid,requisite model of the decision problem."}
{"text": "7.3.2 Risk Analysis Steps\n\nThe first step in the risk analysis process is to characterize the firm/organizational values [2]that will drive the spec- ification of alternatives.In a drilling context,this may be straightforward and it may not be necessary to re-invent the wheel for each drilling decision.However,the fact that the alternative set should be grounded in firm values and values- driven objectives should not be forgotten.This is known as setting the decision frame,in which firm personnel determine the givens in a decision problem,decisions to be made now,and decisions to be made later [3]."}
{"text": "Risk analysis is about developing scales and measures for different risky variables and then using those measures to evaluate already-developed alternatives.The process of developing alternatives is important,and,to restate,should be driven by firm values and objectives.While the formal risk-analysis process may be separated from the alternative- generation process,those involved in the specification of alternatives should be somewhat familiar with the major risks faced by the firm."}
{"text": "Once alternatives are specified,then key risks must be identified.Identification is just that,naming and verbal descriptions of factors that are unknown,but may assume different values or levels that may differentially impact a drilling project.Identification can be an iterative process; as the risk and decision analysis process proceeds,the actual(key)risks to be considered may be revisited and/or reevaluated."}
{"text": "In this chapter two general risk analysis methods are presented;qualitative and quantitative assessments.A qual- itative assessment may be less arduous than a quantitative assessment of one or more risky variables,but the qual- itative assessment is likely to be less useful in valuing investments or determining expected returns."}
{"text": "7.3.3 Risk and Risk Analysis Definitions\n\nUncertainty is generally defined as a lack of knowledge about the nature of future events,in this case,related to drilling and/or development decisions.One goal of risk analysis is transformation of variables from uncertain(no specific knowledge about possible future outcomes)to risky status.The uncertain variable must be identified,but will be otherwise unspecified.As noted above,the uncertain variable must be considered key,or potentially impactful to the drilling-investment decision."}
{"text": "In that case,a risk analysis for the uncertain variable— and other key uncertain factors—is appropriate prior to undertaking a drilling project or other development-related capital investment decision.We define a risky factor,event, or,generally,variable with one or more possible outcomes that,preferably,have been specified and modeled with a probability distribution."}
{"text": "geopolitics),domestic production (like demand,influenced by local regulatory environment and consumer preferences), and cost (influenced by the local regulatory environment)\n\nSupply,another risky variable,is impacted by geopol- itics,domestic production,and international production. Then supply and demand combine to influence price,which is a key factor—along with the drilling decision taken—in success as measured by ROI."}
{"text": "The drilling decision,and the alternative ultimately selected,can directly impact ROI and costs.This is because of the possibility different drilling locations,equipment used,and other specific decision components.Note that the drilling decision does not impact demand,price,or any other risk variables save cost—as some alternatives may have different cost factors than others—in this example."}
{"text": "If variables such as the local regulatory environment are modeled,a qualitative approach—as presented below—can be a reasonable way to analyze drilling risks,especially if the project is long-term and features multiple connected risky variables.However,a purely qualitative approach to risk assessment cannot be used to do more than filter alternatives and,possibly,generate alternative rankings."}
{"text": "Qualitative risk analyses cannot generate net present value(NPV)or ROI measures.In order to generate numer- ical evaluation measures for risky drilling decisions,quan- titative risk assessment and analysis methods are required."}
{"text": "Because risk analyses in general will require inputs from experts,including individuals who will be working on the drilling project,the process of generating risk measures can provide side benefits resulting from participation in the risk assessment and analysis process.Examples include team building,intra-firm communication,and the motivational benefits that accrue when all levels are involved in decision framing."}
{"text": "7.3.5.1 Qualitative Analysis for a Single Risky Variable\n\nIn a development environment and business climate where many possible investment alternatives exist,qualitative risk assessments can be used as an initial screening mechanism—much as they may also be used as a way to identify key risks that are candidates for quantitative modeling efforts.At the project level,firms may elect to delay or deny investment in projects with more than one \"unfavorable\"risk.Series of qualitative assessments may also be used to rank projects prior to proceeding with more analytical approaches to analyzing risks."}
{"text": "In a qualitative risk assessment and analysis,the risky variable in question will be defined verbally(as opposed to probabilistically;see below)in terms of potential impacts to the firm(or other decision-making entity).It is preferable to use a verbal scale with pre-defined terms that are understood and agreed-upon by all involved in the risk assessment process."}
{"text": "As an example of a qualitative definition of a risky variable,consider the regulatory environment variable— and in the case of a dynamic political environment the environment may be difficult to specify during the planning stages of a drilling project—that might be determined as a variable to be considered in the process of evaluating drilling investment alternatives.Suppose that the scale of potential verbal assessments ranges from \"Favorable\"to \"Mixed\"to “Unfavorable.\"An example of how these terms might be defined is presented below."}
{"text": "Suppose that the status of the regulatory environment at the time of the start of a project—if it is indeed started— is unknown,but the firm wishes to model the possible range of outcomes for capital-planning purposes.From the perspective of the firm,the three potential outcomes of the environmental assessment could be defined as follows:\n\nFavorable: the development project as proposed will be in compliance and will not face major regulatory issues regarding water disposal,emissions,noise,added safety regulations,or other factors.Projected impacts on project cost and time-to-completion are minimal."}
{"text": "Mixed: the development project as proposed may not be in complete compliance with regulations concerning water disposal,emissions,noise,added safety regula- tions,or other factors.The projected cost and time- to-completion impacts for making the drilling project compliant are moderate."}
{"text": "Unfavorable: the development project as proposed will not be in compliance with several or many existing and anticipated regulations.Projected cost and time-to- completion impacts if project is to be made compliant are extreme."}
{"text": "Note that,in this example,cost is an explicit measure of the potential impact,but this unknown-in-advance (and there- fore risky)variable is not directly specified.Instead,it is assessed as minimal,moderate,or extreme.In a qualitative assessment the analyst would strive to develop numerical measures,whether discrete or continuous,for the cost variable.Thus the \"minimal,\"\"moderate,\"and “extreme” scale used in the example above would be abandoned in favor of a quantitative assessment of potential costs in each of the three regulatory scenarios,which could mean three distinct cost models with each contingent on one regulatory scenario."}
{"text": "Qualitative assessments are often achievable relatively quickly vis-à-vis qualitative assessments,and the assess- ment costs are also likely to be lower.However,qualitative assessments do not enable computations such as NPV or ROI because the assessment is not numerical."}
{"text": "7.3.5.3 Numerical Scoring\n\nNumerical scoring is another commonly used qualitative way to differentiate between alternatives within different risk categories.This topic is considered a qualitative risk analysis methodology in this chapter because the numerical scores are ordinal.A higher score may be construed as being better than a lower score,but we cannot conclude the degree to which a higher score is better.Just as we cannot exactly specify the difference between \"favorable\"and \"mixed\"or \"mixed\"and “unfavorable\",the difference between scores of 7 and 5 and 4 and 2 may not be equal in an ordinal scale."}
{"text": "Sometimes drilling(and,generally,oil and gas)firms develops risk matrices where either verbal categories such as those presented in the single-variable case above are generated for each variable,or ordinal scores are generated for each variable,or both.These often result in large matrices with ordinal scores in individual cells.In these cases the idea is the same;the matrix maybe used as a filter to identify undesirable,dominated alternatives."}
{"text": "7.3.6 Quantitative Risk Analysis\n\nIf one or more identified and defined risks are to be quantitatively modeled,then all possible realizations must be defined in a numerically measurable way and must all have associated probabilities.A quantitative measure must therefore be established.Money is an obvious measure,but the risk-analysis methods presented here are applicable to non-financial measures that are cardinal—as opposed to the ordinal measures discussed above—measures.A cardinal measure is one where the differences between levels on the measure are meaningful.Thus,the difference between $100 and $50 is easily understood.In the case of an ordinal measure,all that can be concluded from scores of 100 and 50 is that one is greater than the other.Any conclusions about relative worth cannot safely be reached in the case of ordinal measures."}
{"text": "The quantitative characterization of the risk must be complete—all possible outcomes measured on the dimen- sion of interest(such as money)must be identified and the sum of the outcome probabilities must be one.A qualitative risk assessment may be useful as a precursor to a quan- titative assessment,particularly when a decision situation features many risky variables with multiple interactions. The qualitative assessment can be used as a risk filter to help analysts and decision makers identify the variables that are most critical and therefore should be subject to the time and effort (by eliminating undesirable alternatives)associated with a correct quantitative modeling analysis."}
{"text": "7.3.6.1 Assessment of Risk Distributions\n\nRisky variables have to be modeled in order to be useful in an analytical capital-investment decision process.We present an example modeling exercise in which the objec- tive is,as of 3April 2015,the estimation a distribution of the spot price for WTI crude oil in April,2016.The objective of the risk assessment is specification of a distribution instead of a point estimate.Assessing a probability distribution for critical variables can be a painstaking—perhaps even painful—process,but for major decisions with critical risks, it is a process that should be undertaken.Use of point estimates for critical variables,particularly variables that are easily measured (though not necessarily easily modeled),is not conducive to development of a valid risk or decision model."}
{"text": "Anytime a risky variable can be characterized by an exhaustive list of outcomes and associated probabilities,that risky variable may be said to be modeled by a probability distribution.Of course,a valid probability distribution— where outcomes and probabilities together comprise an accurate representation of the risky variable at hand—is very important.Many bad decisions can be made based on invalid probability distributions.Much of what follows in this assessment section is a discussion of methods that may be used to generate valid and useful probability models for critical risks."}
{"text": "First,though,a short review of probability distributions is presented."}
{"text": "7.3.6.2 Review of Probability Distributions\n\nIf we define a discrete random variable(that is,a measure of a risk that may take more than one integer value in a non- deterministic way)Y,then the probability that Y=y,where y is some possible realization of Y,is written as Pr(Y=y). Discrete drilling risks that could be modeled include the number of major problems either in total or of a specific type—in a pre-specified time period or on a per-well basis."}
{"text": "For a continuous distribution,the probability measures are for intervals rather than specific values.For example, instead of Pr(Y=y),the measure is whether the realization of the random variable is less(or greater)than y:Pr(Y≤y). If Pr(Y≤y)=k,then y is expressed as the\"k\"or “kth\" fractile of the distribution."}
{"text": "In order to develop a model for a variable character- ized by a continuous probability distribution,the assess- ment process should result in specification of at least three distribution fractiles for the risky variable under consideration."}
{"text": "The example presented here is development of a prob- ability distribution for the price of WTI crude oil in mid- April,2016 as hypothetically assessed in April,2015. Assessing a distribution as an input to the capital investment decision making process instead of a static,single-price estimate is preferred because(a)the distribution will allow the riskiness of the decision to be formally represented,and (b)the process of assessment of the distribution will require that decision makers think hard about this(or any other) very important risky input [1,6,7]."}
{"text": "The goal of assessment for a key variable is to develop probability and outcome information for that variable. This provides the decision maker(s)with a probability distribution that may be used in many different types of decision models.Assessment provides a way to avoid merely asking an expert for a number or series of numbers [8,9].Instead,utilizing a proven assessment methodology allows the expert to provide thoughtful estimates based on comparisons between hypothetical decision scenarios(see below)."}
{"text": "Examples of desirable outcomes might include all- expense-paid vacations,sporting-event tickets and associ- ated transportation and hotel rooms,or other outcomes that are desirable to the expert whose distribution is being assessed.Note that the outcomes are not,and should not be, measured in financial terms."}
{"text": "The analyst should assist in the process by iteratively changing X values in a manner that encourages the expert to think hard about the value for which he is truly indifferent. Once the X value associated with a probability of 0.5 for receiving the desirable outcome in Alternative B,the median fractile of the price distribution has been assessed. The next step should be to assess at least two more fractiles, preferably toward the ends of the future-price distribution. Thus the next two fractiles should be the(0.05,0.95) fractiles—or the(0.1,0.9)fractiles."}
{"text": "The human mind uses some well-known heuristics when confronted with the need to specify specific values such as X in this assessment example [10,11].For that reason,it is probably preferable to begin the assessment with one of the end values-either 0.05(or 0.1)or 0.95(or 0.9),and do the median assessment last."}
{"text": "7.3.7 Risk Estimation and Modeling Using Data\n\nIn many drilling decision situations,historical data for the variable under consideration may be available,sometimes in large quantities.The presence of historical data does not eliminate the need for expert judgment and,perhaps, an assessment process.Data should never be ignored,and the assessment process can be used to provide updated estimates that enable expert judgment to be considered in addition to the distribution estimate(s)provided by data[12]."}
{"text": "When using historical price data to evaluate a future spot-price distribution,it is often preferable to think about future prices in terms of percentage differences from current (or past)price or prices.This is because the distribution for (in this case,annual)changes is easier to model and also easier to use to forecast the price distribution for the future date."}
{"text": "The average annual WTI price change over this period was 7.2%,and the median change was 11%.The maximum price drop was 68%(-68%),and the maximum day-to-one- year change was 165%."}
{"text": "The 5%fractile—the annual change that was smaller than 95%of the changes—is-36%,and the 95%fractile is 73%.Using these data,along with the median of 7.2%and the spot price of 49.14(http://www.oil-price.net/),results in a cumulative distribution estimate of (31.24,0.05),(52.7, 0.5),and(85.04,0.95)[7]."}
{"text": "At this point,the expert(s)can be consulted once again."}
{"text": "The output of a process such as the one demonstrated in this section should be the same:a probability distribution for the variable—in this case,the spot price of WTI crude in April,2016.Note that the example above is in the context of estimation ofthe WTI price for one period in the future."}
{"text": "comes modeled for each activity,this will result in 2⁴=16 total cost outcomes in the model;three outcomes modeled for each activity will result in 3⁴=81 total outcomes and so on.Outcomes may come from data,subjective expert judgment,or—preferably—both.Risky cost outcomes may be assessed as either a list of(exhaustive)discrete cost out- comes or they may be assessed as a continuous probability distribution for each cost factor."}
{"text": "● Parameters chosen based on historical data may be irrelevant for the current decision situation."}
{"text": "A wide variety of continuous distributions exist for modeling of cost and other distributions.An excellent flexible candidate is the beta general distribution.However, assessing the parameters for this 4-parameter distribution must be done with great care.Further,unlike the normal distribution,the distribution resulting from combinations of beta general distributions is often difficult to specify without the use of simulation."}
{"text": "On the other hand,discrete outcomes are associated with a discrete probability for each outcome.As noted above,the sum of the set of probabilities for outcomes associated with each risk factor must be one."}
{"text": "Once this process is complete,a distribution with 16 outcomes and associated probabilities will be assessed.To reiterate,an assessment methodology such as the tech- nique presented earlier in this chapter should be used,and conditional probabilities should be carefully assessed.An experienced assessment subject(s)—one(s)who understand probability and may have been through an assessment process in the past—is preferred for generation of these discrete probabilities."}
{"text": "7.3.9 Using Assessed Risks in Evaluation of Drilling Alternatives\n\nDeveloped probability distributions can be used in proforma capital investment evaluation models where simulation is used to determine probability distributions for output vari- ables of interest."}
{"text": "Use of quantitative risk assessments for multiple future dates may involve the somewhat-cumbersome task of devel- opment of multiple distributions.This may require multiple individual distribution assessments.On the other hand,this may be accomplished by shortening the timeframe for a sin- gle assessment.For example,a cash-flow analysis done on a quarterly basis can be done by assessing a price distribution for quarterly price changes instead of the price itself.Then the quarterly change(return)distribution may be used in the cash-flow analysis."}
{"text": "7.3.10 Conclusion\n\nA risk analysis is only as good as the process used to develop it.For a major,risky,drilling investment decision, the risk analysis process should be the responsibility of one or more people who have the ability to solicit inputs from subject-matter experts and other parties critical to the eventual success of the project."}

{"text": "An important caveat is that an evaluation model is only as good as its inputs and the way(s)those inputs are connected to produce projections in the form of model outputs.The modeler/analyst should always be specific about assumptions and other factors that contributed to the development of the model.In that spirit,we note the following:\n\n1.All factors were initially treated as constants.Decline rates,produced water levels,and other production fac- tors are modeled with state-of-the art techniques."}

{"text": "4.Benefits from abandonment,such as sale of the property and/or equipment salvage,are not considered."}
{"text": "5.Depreciation is not considered in the cash flow model. This is associated with leasing of capital equipment or use of already-depreciated equipment owned by the development company."}
{"text": "Item 3 in the above list has to do with the notion of real options,which may be thought of as the ability— but not the requirement—to change the project after it has begun.Selling of ownership shares,shutting in of some wells,increasing the number of wells,and/or abandoning the project are all examples of real downstream options associated with a major development project."}
{"text": "A more comprehensive analysis would involve input from company personnel with regard to feasible down- stream decision options to include in a capital allocation analysis.Inclusion of the option to pursue additional down- stream alternatives,often when key uncertainties have been resolved,will often increase the time-0 valuation of an investment project."}
{"text": "Third element:Reserves are amounts of oil and gas that may be produced economically(meaning present value income greater than present value costs)with specified technology.If applied technology changed,then produced quantities (reserves)and NPV will change.What may be considered economical for one company may not be considered economical for another.What is considered economical at the \"As of Date\"may not be economical at some date in the future."}

{"text": "In this case,management would accept the project based on IRR and NPV criteria,and reject the project based on the ROI criterion.Care must be taken in setting multi-faceted objectives such as these because they are interrelated."}
{"text": "The reader willnote that a NPV threshold that is greater than 0(rather than the generally-accepted threshold of O) is stated in the example.The stated NPV implies a higher IRR threshold than is stated in the example,and is also inconsistent with the stated ROI.In fact,the above three example goals are inconsistent,and part of the analysts job may be to help management develop consistent financial measures for project evaluation."}

The key would be to generate reasonable models for the important factors,and this should be done via an iterative process involving both modeling and business experts."}
